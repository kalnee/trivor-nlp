29: NO GOAL!!! Another close one for City as Jesus tries to hit home on the turn but his shot is stopped bang on the line by Koulibaly, who manages to hack the ball away to safety. The GLT replay shows that the whole ball was no over the line and therefore, no goal. Another is coming though. 
27: Free kick to City as De Bruyne is fouled by Koulibaly. Sane and De Bruyne over it... Sane takes but it hammers straight into the wall.
26: OFF THE POST!!! Oh my goodness, how has De Bruyne not scored there?!It's another absolutely superb break from Man City as Sterling powers through the middle of the park, but rather than going for goal himself, he picks out Sane on the left. The German in turn finds De Bruyne at the top of the box who hammers an effort towards Reina. It's the sweetest curler but it absolutely smashes the underside of the crossbar before landing the wrong side of the goal line. We've seen him score from there before but not quite today! Yet... 
24: Man City are just knocking the ball between themselves at the moment without any real pressure from Napoli at the back. But they work it well forward as Sane punts a ball through the box but Sterling cannot connect. CLOSE!! Nearly a third for City as Fernandinho latches onto another Napoli loose pass and picks out the run of Silva in the box, but the captain's outstretched leg just pokes the ball wide. 
20: Poor from Zielinski as his loose pass is latched on to by De Bruyne. You don't want him on a loose pass, let me tell you. The Belgian bursts forward and there is plenty of tika taka passing between the attacking players and as Silva tries to slot Sane through, Alibol does well to get back and challenge. 
18: A great run from Sterling as De Bruyne pumps a ball down the right flank, looking for the winger to latch onto it and he does, but there is no one there to help and he is forced to play it back.
