FT: Romelu Lukaku's strike in the 20th minute earns United three points! Southampton asked all sorts of questions in the second half, but United's defence held firm.
Mourinho was sent off late on for venturing onto the pitch in the final moments! He didn't complain.  

90+4: Ward-Prowse takes, there's a bit of pinball, with goalkeeper Forster in the box too, but Bailly clears, and that's it!

90+4: Jose Mourinho has been sent to the stands! Before the corner was taken, Craig Pawson rushed back to his assistant, and has sent off the Portuguese.
He goes off quietly, shaking the hands of his opposite numbers. We'll find out what happened.

90+4: Corner to Southampton! Surely the final action.

90+3: Rashford makes way for Blind for the final minute. Superb defensive performance from Rashford.

90+1: Herrera buys some time by winning a free-kick in the middle of the park. Four minutes added on.

89: Ward-Prowse takes, but Jones deals with it yet again. What a performance from the defender. 

88: Tadic left in a heap by Matic, who is booked. Now there will be a ball in the box.

87: United doing well to make sure nothing gets into their box. Rashford is all over Ward-Prowse, great discipline from the youngster.

85: Saints change. Charlie Austin on, Shane Long off. 
And another.  Soares comes off, James Ward-Prowse is on.

85: Lukaku is booked for a follow through on Lemina. He got something on the ball, but a booking is just about correct.

83: Saints really piling on the pressure. This would be a vital three points for United given how much Saints have pushed in this second half. 

81: CHANCE! For United this time! Herrera, who has come on for Mata, finds the ball at his feet 12 yards out central, but he blazes it a few yards over Forster's goal!

79: CLOSE! Saints really huffing and puffing here! Tadic slips it in to Romeu at an angle, he sticks it across the face of goal but it's just ahead of Gabbiadini and it runs a yard wide!

77: Lukaku shoves off Romeu, looks to play in Fellaini, but Soares just cleans up ahead of him!


74: Steven Davis makes way for Manolo Gabbiadini for the final 20 minutes or so. 
And for United, Smalling replaces Mkhitaryan as Mourinho reacts to that Saints change.

72: Soares with another inviting ball from the right, but Bailly takes charge this time and clears brilliantly. 
Tadic then crosses from the right; De Gea comes out, and uses one hand to grab it out of thin air!

70: Ouch. Valencia goes in very hard on Davis.  he slips, it's unfortunate, and he's got a booking. 

68: OFF THE LINE! Saints corner, it comes to Romeu who battles and gets a header towards goal, but Fellaini is there to instinctively clear!

67: SAVE! United should be 2-0 up! Mkhitaryan steals the ball high up the pitch for United.  he plays in Lukaku to his right, instead of sticking it back in the middle he goes for goal from an angle, and Forster saves with his feet!

65: United's first attack of the half.  Rashford plays it central into Lukaku, he holds it up well and offloads to Mkhitaryan, but his effort is deflected and loops into Forster's hands. 

63: APPEAL! Long goes down under the challenge of Jones just outside the box, but it's not clear who has caused the offence. Referee Craig Pawson waves play on.
Soares then sticks in a lovely ball, but it's inches away from Long!

61: Redmond is seeing much more of the ball. He gets down the left, sticks a deep ball in, Long gets up, but it's wide.

59: Fine tracking back by Rashford to defend on the left, and Saints have a corner. Davis drives it in, but it's past everyone and United can push out. 

57: SAVE! Redmond cuts inside well from the corner of the box, shoots for the near corner, and De Gea is down well to save, and collect at the second attempt. 

55: United have the ball in a tight area deep in their own half, but they work it brilliantly and Young wins a free-kick. He's been impressive so far.

53: Another corner to Saints.
CLOSE! Tadic takes, Yoshida flicks it through his legs, it deflects off Bailly and falls to Romeu, but he diverts it wide under pressure from Jones! The United defender has been superb so far. 

51: Long tries to attack a fine Ryan Bertrand ball, but it's well defended by Bailly. 
United break at the other end, Rashford slips it towards Lukaku, but Hoedt intercepts again.

49: Davis' corner is deflected, and United can clear. Saints have come out in the second half looking bright. 

48: Davis takes, Bailly and Hoedt tussle, and Hoedt is down holding his ankle in agony. It's another Saints corner, and Hoedt will be OK. 

47: Saints break after fine work from Lemina, and Tadic wins a corner on the right. 

46: Back underway in the second half here.


HT: Romelu Lukaku has United ahead, pouncing on a rebound from Fraser Forster's fine save. Saints yet to really test David De Gea, despite plenty of the ball. 

45+2: Corner to Saints, won by Tadic on the left. Davis delivers, Fellaini clears well, and that's the whistle for half-time.

45: Saints stick the ball in the box in stoppage time, Long wins it, but there's absolutely no support up there. He applauds the ball from Hoedt, but he needs more bodies around him in the second half.

44: Davis sticks in the free-kick, Redmond flicks it on, some pinball in the area ensues before Matic gets rid. No nonsense. 

42: Yellow card for Ashley Young. He goes through Tadic from behind, and now he can't afford to mistime another.

40: Since the goal there hasn't been too much flow to the game. Saints still fighting for the ball and doing OK, but it's just not happening in the final third.

38: Long drags his studs down the back of Fellaini's heel.  he apologises instantly, but Fellaini wriggles around on the ground like he's been shot.
It's not a nice tackle, granted, but I'm not sure it warranted that reaction. Booking for Long, and rightly so. 

36: Mkhitaryan runs 50 yards at Saints' goal with Lukaku running off him, but he can't quite find an angle.
Resulting corner is taken by Mata, into Bailly, but it's into Forster's hands. 

34: Fellaini with a long ball up to Lukaku, who looks to head it down to Mkhitaryan just outside the box, but Saints get rid. 

31: Mkhitaryan plays a lovely one-two with Rashford, looks to pick it up in the area, but is barged off the ball by Lemina! He's leaned in heavily there.  no complaints by United but it's risky from the Saints man.

29: Southampton with the ball deep in United's half. They're looking for movement off the ball, but United are remaining tight and preventing that. Bertrand gets to the byline, but it runs just ahead of him and the visitors clear.

27: CLOSE! Rashford, straight run up, over the wall, and it's inches wide! Fantastic effort from the young star. Forster was nowhere near that!

26: Mata is upended by Yoshida, and this is well in range for a shot on goal. Rahsford and Mata over it.

24: A couple of moments for Saints so far. Bertrand fiercely sticks one into the box, but Valencia is there to clear.

22: United fans are having a dance behind the far goal. It's unlucky for Forster, who made a superb diving save to his right from Lukaku's original fierce header. 


Stoke hold on for a crucial victory! Peter Crouch is the match winner after Maya Yoshida had cancelled out Mame Biram Diouf's opener.

90+3: The ball is bouncing around the Stoke area but the hosts get a lucky break as Soares spoons his volley wide. He wanted a corner but it's a Stoke goal kick. Time is running out.

90+2: SUB! Diouf is replaced by Glen Johnson for Stoke.

90: FIVE minutes of added time.

90: CHANCE! Huge moment for Stoke! Bertrand skips to the byline and looks for an unmarked Gabbiadini but the striker can't turn it home! Butland just got a touch with his foot.
CHANCE! Zouma saves Stoke! Van Dijk wins the initial header, Austin steams in and knocks it past Butland but Zouma is there to hack clear. Southampton are pushing hard.

88: SUBS! Southampton have introduced Charlie Austin for Lemina, while Afellay is on for the hosts.

A massive goal for Stoke and it's Crouch with the tap-in!
Stoke had a penalty appeal turned down when Romeu wiped out Allen but they kept the ball alive through Shaqiri and Pieters.
It then broke to Choupo-Moting after a goalmouth scramble and he poked it towards Crouch, who helped it over the line.
Very messy but Stoke won't care! 

84: Tadic wins a free-kick from Pieters midway inside Stoke's half. Before the set-piece referee Mike Jones comes across to speak to Mark Hughes. It's just a warning.
CHANCE! Soares takes the free-kick and Yoshida is free at the back post. He tries to flick it back into the danger area but can only turn it into the side netting.

82: CHANCE! It's Stoke who almost snatch a goal! Shaqiri slips a super through ball for the advancing Choupo-Moting but Lemina covers brilliantly for Southampton, conceding a corner on the stretch.
Saints clear when the delivery comes in from Shaqiri.

81: Crouch is penalised for clattering into Van Dijk. Southampton have dominated possession and now have their equaliser - can they push for a winner?

78: A much needed goal from Southampton's point of view. They haven't created too much so have Yoshida to thank for pulling something out of nothing.

Just as I was saying Stoke were comfortable they concede! 
It's a brilliant finish by Yoshida, who controls his volley and fires in off the crossbar. It came courtesy of good work by Boufal in the build-up after his initial corner was cleared.

73: This still looks fairly comfortable for Stoke. Most of the play is in front of their midfield and they are simply shuffling across the pitch to deny their opponents space. 

Can Gabbiadini salvage something for Southampton? The Italian is 11/1 to score next with the Saints 16/1 to win and 3/1 to salvage a draw.

70: SUB! First Stoke change - former Southampton striker Peter Crouch replaces Berahino.

69: There's more pretty passing around the Stoke box until Lemina fires it into Gabbiadini, who doesn't read the pass. Goal kick. That sums it up for Southampton.

67: SUB! Another Southampton change sees Redmond replaced by Manolo Gabbiadini. That should be two up front with Long also on the pitch.

67: Southampton are passing the ball around neatly but aren't really threatening Stoke. The hosts will be happy with this as it stands.

63: Boufal gets in front of Cameron to nod the ball into the path of Long but Zouma defends very well to muscle the Southampton forward off the ball in the area. Strong work.

61: Pellegrino has shuffled his pack after that change, Tadic is playing more centrally and closer to Long. Redmond is on the right and Boufal the left.

60: SUB! Boufal replaces Steven Davis for Southampton. Austin and Gabbiadini still on the bench.

60: Choupo-Moting shows great desire and awareness to track Soares' run and concede a corner. Mark Hughes will be pleased with that.
The corner comes to Van Dijk at the back post but the Dutchman doesn't time his jump. Sofiane Boufal is about to come on for the visitors.

57: Tadic turns Pieters inside out on the right and digs out a cross but Long can't generate pace on his header and it drops wide of Butland's goal.

57: YELLOW! Romeu gets beaten by a nice piece of Shaqiri trickery on the touch-line and the Southampton midfielder is in the book.

56: Southampton have failed to score in five of their seven games in all competitions this season. They need to make something happen here.

55: CHANCE! Soares gets his cross right this time, picking out Long, but the striker fires his header over the bar. Better from Southampton.

53: YELLOW! Tadic in the book for taking out Allen.
Watching on Soccer Saturday, Phil Thompson says Stoke should have had another penalty for that Tadic handball appeal: "For me it is a penalty."

51: Van Dijk in the right place at the right time again to challenge Berahino in the box and the Southampton defender does well to head away seconds later.
The ball then falls to Shaqiri and he delivers a great cross but Forster collects when it deflects off Tadic. Stoke want a penalty for handball but referee Mike Jones is not interested.
Long is back on and looks fine to continue.

48: Long clatters into Allen and that's a free-kick to Stoke. Long has hurt himself in the challenge, it seems to be a knee problem.

46: We are back under way for the second half at the bet365.



Will Stoke pay the price for that miss after the break? Southampton are 13/2 for a comeback win, while Berahino is Price Boosted to 9/1 to make amends for his penalty miss by scoring next.

Stoke lead at the break but they will disappointed it's not 2-0. Diouf nodded them in front and they had an immediate chance to double their lead but Forster saved Berahino's spot-kick.
Berahino has not scored a league goal since February 2016. The wait goes on.

45: THREE minutes of added time.

43: PENALTY SAVED! Forster dives to his left and keeps out Berahino's spot-kick. A super stop by the Southampton goalkeeper, who has been very good today. That's bailed out Van Dijk.

42: PENALTY TO STOKE! Van Dijk has been great today but this is a poor decision. It's a soft one but Berahino goes down under his contact and referee Mike Jones points to the spot.

Stoke force a succession of corners and Shaqiri finally delivers some quality, picking out Diouf with an excellent cross.
It's poor marking from Southampton to allow Diouf to nod past Forster. Nothing the Southampton goalkeeper could do.

38: Superb defending by Van Dijk, who steals the ball from Allen just as the Stoke midfielder was shaping up to shoot inside the Southampton area.
The Saints defender then rises well to head away for a corner with Diouf lurking.

36: Stoke counter after Soares is caught of position and the Southampton right-back chases back and needlessly bundles over Pieters near the corner.
The hosts deliver but Long meets it well to clear.

35: Zouma makes a meal of a clearance under pressure from Long and Southampton win a corner out of nothing. That's what Long brings to this Saints team. If only he could add goals.
Diouf is back on as Stoke defend the resulting corner.

33: Stoke have an injury concern as Diouf has stayed down after a tackle on the left by Tadic. He seems to be holding his shoulder.

31: SAVE! Forster keeps Southampton level again! The referee plays a good advantage to allow Stoke to break and Choupo-Moting bursts through, turning Yoshida and testing Forster. A good stop.
32: YELLOW! Allen is in the book for chopping down Tadic.

28: Another good move by Southampton gets let down by a poor cross by Bertrand. Mark Hughes looks frustrated on the touch-line, his team is struggling to get a foot on the ball.

27: Southampton are starting to exert a little control over this game now. Lemina is looking very bright in midfield and alongside Romeu it is a strong partnership. Stoke are dropping slightly too deep.

24: CHANCE! A Southampton free-kick is poorly cleared by Choupo-Moting, bounces off Romeu and falls to Long. The striker swivels in the box but Butland is already out and smothers the effort. Southampton can't buy a goal this season.

22: CHANCE! Stoke open up Southampton with a great passage of play. Choupo-Moting holds up the ball in the box and slides a fantastic pass for Allen, who looks for Shaqiri on the cut-back. Bertrand was alive to the danger, though, and clears for the visitors.

21: Southampton's crossing has just let them down on a couple of occasions and Soares gets it wrong again for the away side. He only really had Long to aim for in the middle but put it into the stand.

18: CHANCE! Super build-up by Southampton as Tadic turns into space and plays a perfectly-timed pass for Redmond. The forward isn't strong enough, though, and pokes his shot wide when one-on-one with Butland. Redmond should have done better.


It ends 1-1 at Turf Moor with Chris Wood's 85th-minute header cancelling out Michail Antonio's opener with Andy Carroll's sending-off in between  making this a better point for the visitors. But they had nine minutes to hold onto all three points before Wood's well-placed header.

90+3: It looks like being a battling point for West Ham, which will be a source of frustration for Sean Dyche after the run his side has been on. 

90: How is that a corner? The ball clearly hits Wood last and Zabaleta is furious. Ah.  but a quick discussion with assistant Eddy Smart and Attwell gets the decision right in the end. We're now into four minutes of stoppage time.

89: Burnley are coming on really strong now as Lowton wins a corner. But they play it short, with Brady's left-foot effort dragged into the grateful arms of Hart.

87: SUB! Bilic opts to bring on Arthur Masuaku for these final few minutes. He replaces Lanzini.

86: BOOKED! Wood and Reid were booked for a bit of pushing and shoving inside the mouth of the goal after the equaliser. 

It's textbook Chris Wood as the big target man meets a delicious ball from Gudmundsson to head the ball into the bottom corner leaving Hart with no chance. Game on!

84: Another test for Hart he passes as he punches the ball clear under pressure from Wood. Can Burnley find an equaliser in the final five minutes?

83: Brady produces a wand of a ball from the left, as it bends away from Hart. Fonte clears, but behind him, Hart clatters into Barnes. He's nowhere near the ball and he completely took Barnes out!

82: Slaven Bilic will be delighted with how his side have reduced Burnley to very few chances despite playing against 10 men since the 29th minute of the first half. They've created one or two chances of their own too.

81: SUB! Stephen Ward is replaced by Ashley Barnes. That should push Brady to left-back, with Barnes giving the hosts a more physical presence for the final nine minutes plus stoppage time.

80: BOOKED! Obiang goes into the book for a foul on Defour. He can have no complaints, he was very late.

79: Burnley are going more direct inside the last quarter of an hour. But Reid and Fonte have been resolute so far. 

77: OFFSIDE! Defour is becoming increasingly influential, as he drifts the ball in from the right, onto the head of Wood who flicks the ball onto Tarkowski, but he's a yard offside before he clatters into Hart.

75: Sakho is straight into the action to win a corner for his side, which is taken by Lanzini, but Burnley are all back to clear.

74: Javier Hernandez is going off, again. He's not best pleased, but Bilic shouldn't be criticised this time. It's a sensible one, as Diafra Sakho - the match winner against Swansea - comes on in his place. 

73: West Ham clear their lines before Kouyate gets his effort to hack a long ball back into the area clear, with the ball gratefully collected by Hart. No intentional back-pass there!

72: Brady and Defour stand over it. Attwell tells Fonte you can't throw people out of the way. Defour shoots, but it's off the wall, and Cork then wins a corner off Lanzini.

71: West Ham aren't happy but Jack Cork has won a free-kick after Antonio left his leg out. This is an excellent position for Robbie Brady, dead centre.

70: Wood drops a little deep to collect the ball, with the striker laying the ball out wide to Defour. The Belgian whips the ball into the box onto the head of Vokes, but it's not troubling Hart.

65: Antonio, who has now scored all of his last six Premier League goals away from home, cuts inside and gets plenty of power on his shot, but it is gathered by Pope. Perhaps a ball that was on for Lanzini was the better option there.

63: OFF THE POST! Gudmundsson cuts inside Cresswell and shoots from 25 yards, but his effort smacks the post and is gathered by Hart. He knows he's fortunate the ball didn't hit his back and go in. The ball bounces back into his arms. Burnley are desperately unlucky to still find themselves behind!

61:  This is another terrific ball into the box from Brady, around the corner to Wood who fires it across from the byline, but Vokes isn't on his toes. Burnley are building a head of steam.


60: Javier Hernandez is fouled but he's asking for a yellow card for Ben Mee. No need for that. Home fans show their frustration with the Mexico forward.

58: Matt Lowton simply has to get the ball on this. Defour swings the ball in, and it goes all the way through to the former Aston Villa full-back who dives in a vain attempt to meet it, but from two yards out, he just leaves his leap a second too late, and ball goes out for a goal-kick!

57: SAVE! It's beautiful football from West Ham, all one-touch football, as Obiang starts by back-heeling the ball into Hernandez, who plays a one-two with Lanzini before the ball is worked to Antonio on the overlap, but he appears to hit the ball twice as his effort is tipped around the post by Pope! What a goal that would've been.

56: The West Ham wall does its job, but the ball loops up into the area and eventually goes out for a goal-kick.

55: Bilic will be fuming with Fonte, who gives away a cheap free-kick for a foul on Sam Vokes. It's about 30 yards out with Brady standing over it.

54: Gudmundsson wins a corner off Zabaleta. West Ham are a lot more vulnerable in these situations since Andy Carroll went off, but Cresswell clears the danger.

52: Nice interlinking from West Ham as Lanazini feeds Obiang, who tries a curler from the edge of the box but it's meat and drink for Pope.

50: OFFSIDE! Wood has a shot that is blocked by Fonte and the ball is then fed through to Sam Vokes, who goes down under a challenge from Reid, but the referee has already seen the linesman's flag for offside.

47: CHANCE! West Ham have made a positive start to the second half as Pope's poor clearance is pounced upon, and Manuel Lanzini's fierce cross is inches away from the outstretched Antonio. 

46: Arfield and Hendrick make way for Sam Vokes and Johann Gudmundsson.
West Ham have also made a change with Pedro Obiang coming on for Arnautovic.


It was a cagey first-half at times, but the only goal of the game so far came from Michail Antonio. A long punt from Joe Hart found the former Nottingham Forest man, and he rounded Pope to score. 
But the visitors will have to play the second-half with 10 men after Andy Carroll received the third red card of his career for two very similar bookable offences as the striker connected with the point of his arm in challenges with James Tarkowski and Ben Mee - all in the space of one minute and 40 seconds. 

45+1: Hernandez lays the ball off to Lanzini, he shoots from distance and it takes a deflection off Tarkowski, but Pope gathers the ball with ease.

45: SHOT! That's a good chance on the stroke of half-time, as Hart gets a good punch on Ward's cross but it falls to Defour on the edge of the box and he slams the ball over the bar! 
We're into two added minutes at the end of this half.

44: Joe Hart will take his time with this goal-kick, after Hendrick's lofted pass goes harmlessly off the pitch. We should see a fascinating second-half based on what we've seen in these opening 44 minutes.

42: It's all about organisation now for Slaven Bilic, who is out there on the touchline barking instructions at his players, who have a few minutes to hold out before the interval, when they can regroup. They've dropped into a back six.

40: BOOKED! Steven Defour goes into the book for a foul on Cresswell, who was caught just as he was trying to clear his lines.

38: Arfield produces a lovely flick around the corner, and a slip from Jose Fonte almost allows him to get onto his own touch before the Portugal defender recovers to hack the ball clear. Hendrick then tries his luck from distance, but his shot sails harmlessly over the bar.
David Moyes, who has been linked with the vacant Scotland job, strokes him chin watching on in the stands. Last five minutes or so of a first-half that has not seen too many clear-cut openings but with West Ham protecting a 1-0 lead.

37: Not a great deal has changed in terms of West Ham's shape since Carroll's dismissal with Chicharito ploughing a lone furrow now up front.

36: Hendrick tries to take the game by the scruff of its neck for Burnley, playing a block one-two with Brady, but he is adjudged to have fouled Reid. West Ham just want to take the sting out of the game at present.

34: Javier Hernandez has gone down after a rash challenge from Ben Mee. There's definitely a current here at the moment as the Burnley fans let their feelings known to the match official.

32: PENALTY APPEAL! Brady threads the ball through to Chris Wood, and Hart is out in a flash, but he catches the striker. He pulls his hand away, but Wood gets to the ball first. It's a definite penalty, but Attwell sees it as just a corner. 
Hart got plenty of contact with Wood's ankle. He was fortunate the other day in similar circumstances for England!

31: There was one minute and 39 seconds between the two yellow cards. There was no intent in the first challenge, but he's just been booked. Carroll wins some of the ball with the duel with Mee, but he certainly catches the defender as well. It's the third sending-off of his career.

27: RED CARD! Within minutes, Andy Carroll is off. Second yellow card. Sheer stupidity.  This is more of a booking than the first one, as he tries to win the ball in a challenge with Bee Mee this time, and he again catches the defender. Attwell brandishes another yellow, then a red. 

26: BOOKED! Andy Carroll is judged to have used his elbow on James Tarwkowski. He certainly catches him, but he's looking at the ball. What else can he do? But Attwell shows him a yellow card.



FT: Blimey. Where to start. Two Premier League games, 13 goals. 
Watford looked to be in control of this one at 2-1 with goals from Okaka and Doucoure, but then Salah started to find his feet on debut. He won the penalty for 2-2 - Firmino scored - and then bundled home what looked like the winner. But yet more questionable Liverpool defending handed Britos an equaliser in the fourth minute of added-time.  

90+6: CHANCE!! Surely not another one? My fingers couldn't take it. Wijnaldum finds himself free in the box about 15 yards out. He strikes. but Brittos gets a crucial deflection onto the ball which bobbles into the arms of Gomes. There's the whistle.

Just when you think you've seen it all in the last two days. Watford have stolen a late leveller! Incredible!
Liverpool fail to clear a corner and Richarlison smashes one at goal from the by-line. Mignolet spoons it onto the bar and Britos reacts quickest to bundle the ball over the line from a yard out. Once again, questions will be raised about Liverpool's defending. They've thrown this one away. What drama.


90+3: PRESSURE! Here come Watford. Holebas whips in a cross from the right. Mignolet punches clear...  

90+1: SUB! Alexander-Arnold is replaced by Gomez.

89: Watford are trying to put some pace into their attacks - but Liverpool are coping with their late charge.
90: Five minutes added on.

85: CHANCE!! Wijnaldum has never scored a Premier League goal away from home.. and he still hasn't. The ball drops to him 12 yards out but he skews an effort well wide.
86: SUB! Milner replaces Salah, who has had an exceptional second half. 

82: Can pings a stupendous ball over the top in behind Holebas for Salah to chase. Gomes races off his line and just gets there ahead of the nippy Liverpool attacker.

78: Now Kaboul is down for Watford. They've strapped his left knee up as he must solider on due to the fact they've made all their changes. 
80: SUB! Liverpool make a change. Firmino - who has been quiet but has scored one and made one - is replaced by Origi. 

75: CHANCE! This game is opening up now. Doucouré shows some neat tricks in midfield but Henderson nips in to break it up. Liverpool break and Salah sprints in behind Holebas with a clever run. It's a tight angle but he only has Gomes to beat. Straight into the side netting. 


72: The crowd stand as one for a round of applause in appreciation of Graham Taylor, who passed away earlier this year. Nice touch.

68: BRILLIANT! Emre Can charges Liverpool up the field. His first touch to pluck the ball out of the air to kick-start the attack was sublime. The play develops and they win a corner.
70: SAVE!! Once again, the attacking team are first to the ball. Firmino finds Lovren at the near post but his header is palmed away by Gomes. It's all Liverpool - it's like someone has flicked a switch.

Live Watford v Liverpool Price Boosts.

64: SAVE!! Moreno drives forward from left back and muscles Femenía out of the way. He tries a dipping volley from 25 yards and Gomes has to tip it over the crossbar. That's the first effort on target that's not gone in. Amazing. 
66: CROSSBAR!! Firmino pings his corner to the near post and Matip beats Kaboul in the air. It's a well directed flick that beats Gomes but the woodwork comes to Watford's rescue. They've gone to pieces in the last 15 minutes. 

WHAT. A. TURNAROUND. 
Lovren chips a lovely ball in behind the Watford back four and Firmino races onto it. He lifts it over Gomes but the ball is slipping wide of the post until Salah comes charging in to bundle the ball home from close range. What a few minutes for the new man!

No mistake from the striker, who takes over the penalty duties from Milner. He sends Gomes the wrong way. Game on..

54: PENALTY TO LIVERPOOL!! Salah shows his pace behind and is fouled by Gomes, who comes charging out and clips the winger. 

50: OFFSIDE! Richarlison nearly gets in straight away. Okaka makes space and threads the ball through for the Brazilian but he goes too soon. Two yards offside.
52: Watford still look bright. Amrabat swings a ball into the danger zone from the right. Richarlison wins his header at the back post but the referee stops play for a push on Lovren.

48: SUB! Having lost Janmaat in the first half, now Pereyra is struggling for the hosts. He's tweaked his groin and will need to be replaced. That man is Richarlison, who is on for his Watford debut. 

Live Watford v Liverpool Price Boosts.

45: Hello again. I hope you're suitably refreshed. Liverpool have work to do to salvage this one. They get the second-half going..

Click here to make your entry.


HT: Plenty of smiles in the home end. Okaka took advantage of some sloppy Liverpool marking before Mane levelled it up with a splendid finish. That should have settled Liverpool down but more haphazard defending presented Doucouré with a chance that he took for 2-1. All to play for...

45+2: Liverpool pin Watford deep in their own half. Henderson loops a ball over the top for Salah on the right flank. He has support in the middle but shanks his cross into the stands. Not happened for him in the opening 45 minutes. 
45+4: CLOSE!! Liverpool force a corner. Firmino send over a delicious centre which is met by a on-the-move Mane. He reverses a header towards the far post but it skims just wide. Gomes was rooted to the spot. 


42: CORNER! A few worried faces in the Liverpool end as Okaka forces a corner. This time Can goes to do a man-marking job on the big man and Mignolet comes to claim a pretty tame Cleverley delivery. 
44: Four minutes added on. 

38: CHANCE!! First signs from Salah. He sprints away down the right and fashions an opportunity. For some reason he decides to toe-poke it from eight yards out but makes a hash of it. Skied over the bar. 

36: YELLOW! Mane into the book. Frustration starting to show? He leaves a naughty stud on the ankle of Doucouré - the referees sees it and a card is shown. 

Liverpool are back in it for just two minutes. Cleverley makes good ground down the right and sends a low ball into the six-yard box. There's Liverpool defenders sliding everywhere but they can't clear it. It drops to Doucouré, who burst into the box, and he smashes home from close range. 

Ruthless and quite brilliant attacking from the Reds. They venture deep into Watford territory and get their passing game going. Moreno finds Can, who flicks a sensational ball into the path of Mane. He only has Gomes to beat but makes it look easy - curling into the far corner. Liverpool are off and running. 

27: A chant of "Merson, Merson - what's the score" echoes around the ground. Perhaps in regards to the great man's prediction that Watford will be relegated. Their team in full control currently.  


24: Nothing is sticking up top for Liverpool. Kaboul is first to everything. Not sure Firmino has won a 50-50 challenge yet.
25: CHANCE! Cleverley dances into space down the right. He floats a ball into the middle which calls for Mignolet to charge off his line and scramble the ball clear. 

21: Over a quarter of the game gone and Gomes hasn't had a save to make. No shots on goal so far from Liverpool - they are very flat. Watford doing all the positive work. Okaka still giving Lovren the runaround. 

16: Trouble here for Janmaat - he looks to have tweaked a muscle at the top of his leg. He goes off for a bit of treatment, but is OK to continue, for now. Doesn't look good. 
17: SUB! Femenía - a free transfer from Alaves - is on to replace him. 

11: Vicarage Road is bouncing. Marco Silva is all smiles. Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp instructs his team to keep their chins up. No response as yet - Watford in control with Okaka providing a brilliant platform through the middle. 

The big man strikes - although this is a gift, wrapped up and delivered by the Liverpool defence. The corner is whipped in from the right, Mignolet stays on his line and his defenders stand and watch as Okaka has a free header from four yards out. Mignolet gets a hand to it but he can't keep it out. Can't wait for Carragher to dissect that one at half-time. Shocking defending. 

7: CHANCE!!! Okaka bruises his way through two challenges on half-way and slides a wonderful ball in behind forPereyra to chase. He backs Lovren into the box and fires an effort which is pushed wide by Mignolet. Corner...

Live Watford v Liverpool Price Boosts.

5: Alexander-Arnold looks confident. He moves forward and tries to pick a tough pass for Firmino in behind. He's only inches away from completing it as the ball runs through to Gomes. 

3: Slow start. Defenders seeing most of the ball as both teams keen to ease their way into the season.

1: KICK-OFF! Here we go. The waiting is over. Watford get the game underway. 




The new Watford boss stops for a pre-match chat.


A superb late save from Jordan Pickford denies Stoke a last gasp draw, and it is a fairytale return to the Premier League with Everton for Wayne Rooney after his header wins the match for the hosts. 
Stoke had few clear cut chances to speak of but certainly performed better in the second half.
Stay tuned for match highlights at 5.15pm!

90+3: SAVE!! What a shot from Shaqiri after a darting run but Pickford makes a stop that is more than level to it, pushing away his fierce drive with a strong, leaping save.
Fantastic from both players.

90+2: An end-to-end match now with both sides looking for another late goal, but the defences are doing their job at the moment. Rooney wins a free kick to cheers from the home fans and look to retain the ball.

90: A late corner for Stoke as they ask questions of the Everton defence, but Pickford gets a hand to the delivery and Martina manages to kick it clear. 
Four minutes added on.

88: A deep free kick for Everton as Rooney is fouled. They pump it forward but it looks to be a case of keeping possession now as the seconds tick down.

85: A yellow card for Martina now as he tugs back Choupo-Moting. 

82: Crouch is playing target man for Stoke at the moment as they look to pump balls into the box for the big man to latch onto. However, at the moment, the deliveries are just coming up short for the striker.

80: Choupo-Moting nearly makes it a debut to remember as he tries to hook the ball into the back of the net with a high boot, but he can only find the head of Jagielka as Stoke are penalised for a foul.

77: Another solid debut for Ramirez, who is now replaced by Kevin Mirallas.

76: OFFSIDE!! Nearly an equaliser for Stoke as the ball is played into the box and Diouf tries the spectacular with an overhead kick, but it doesn't quite come off.
But the ball does fall to the waiting Crouch, and he tries to poke it home but Pickford is off his line to block before the linesman flags the Stoke striker for offside.

73: Another decent idea from Everton as Rooney and Calvert-Lewin again link up down the right-hand side before the former whips a cross into the box, finding the head of Ramirez.
Rather than going for goal though, he attempts to head it back into space but there's no one there to convert and Allen clears.

72: Stoke make their first changes as Peter Crouch comes on for Berahino and Bojan makes way for debutante Eric Choupo-Moting.


70: More good play from Everton as Calvert-Lewin is again nearly there to tap home after Keane heads the ball back across goal from a Gueye cross.
The defender picks up a bloody nose in the process and receives some medical attention.

69: SAVE!! Calvert-Lewin beats Zouma this time, leaving the defender on the floor before powering into the box and going for goal on the left-hand side, but Butland makes a superb save to deny Everton the second goal. 
Zouma looks in a bit of bother, but gets up to defend the corner.

66: A few choice words from Allen for the referee there as Schneiderlin clatters into a challenge on the Welshman, but gets away without a booking.
The Everton midfielder is given a talking to by Neil Swarbrick and probably should have been booked really.
Shaqiri takes the free kick but it lands straight into the hands of Pickford.

63: Cries of handball from the Goodison Park faithful as Rooney and Calvert-Lewin again look for an opening in the box and the ball appears to hit the hand of Zouma as he clears.
However, Neil Swarbrick is unmoved and waves away the claims.

62: CLOSE! Better from Everton as Martina picks out Clavert-Lewin in the middle of the box and he rises to meet the cross, but again Zouma is there to deny his a clear shot on goal as the ball goes wide.

60: A solid debut from Klaassan but he makes way for Tom Davies for the final half an hour. A huge cheer for the academy prospect as he comes onto the field.

59: CHANCE!! The best chance Stoke have had this half as Allen does well to pick the ball out of his feet with tackles flying in before slotting into the feet of Fletcher. 
He takes aim and it's a fizzing effort but it just whistles past the post. 

57: Another great move from Everton there and that man Rooney is involved once again with the most sublime cross pitch pass to Baines, who he picks out on the left flank. 
He in turn tries his luck but his effort is blocked before Klaassan attempts to fire home the cleared ball but it lands straight into the arms of Butland.

54: BLOCK!! Great block from Zouma there as Calvert-Lewin looked to be in on goal with only Butland to beat after a fine throughball from Rooney. 
But the Chelsea loanee gets back to tackle the Everton youngster in the box and it's a great effort all around.

52: COLLISION! Get the stretcher out, there's been a three way collision as Clavert-Lewin, Zouma and Butland all end up in a heap on the floor while chasing down a long pass. 
None of them seem too hurt though as Rooney delivers the resulting corner which Stoke clear.

50: CLOSE! Stoke have come racing out of the traps in the second half as Pieters sends a fantastic ball across the face of goal, which four Stoke players miss including Berahino and Diouf. 
While that is going on, Baines is on the floor after taking an elbow to the face from Shaqiri, who is lucky not to be booked there.


47: A half-chance early on for Berahino as he nicks the ball away from Keane who is going to tackle the striker, before attempting to curl the ball into the top corner but it flashes wide.

46: Everton get the game back underway at Goodison Park.

Cuco Martina makes his Everton debut, coming on for Ashley Williams. Ronald Koeman has reverted to a back four after using three centre-backs in the first half



A very quiet first half at Goodison Park until the fourth official signalled for a minute of added time.  Then enter Wayne Rooney.
He nodded home in added time to announce his arrival back at the club in some style after a solid first half performance from the England man.
Both sides will be wanting to tweak their game plans at half-time though.

You just knew he was going to have something to say in this game and it is a fairytale return to Goodison Park for Rooney. 
It is a lovely worked goal which Rooney himself sets off as he plays a one-two with Gueye, who in turn taps into the feet of Ramirez before the latter finds Calvert-Lewin. He in turn whips a cross into the box that meets the head of the forward, and he makes no mistake in firing past Butland. 
It's a fantastic celebration from Rooney and his team-mates, and a timely goal for the hosts.

45: One minute of added time at the end of the first half.

43: Free kick to Stoke as Gueye pulls down Bojan. The Potters man looks to be in a bit of pain but is OK to continue. 
Shaqiri delivers but the Everton defence just about manage to hack it away with a few flailing limbs.

41: Corner for Everton after some good work from Calvert-Lewin who collects a long pass from Rooney, but Pieters just nicks it out of his path.
Rooney delivers into the box but the home side are eventually penalised for a foul, giving Stoke the free kick.

39: So nearly an in road for Everton as Rooney, Gueye and Dominic Calvert-Lewin link up on the right of the pitch but as the former tries to dance past Cameron into the box, the Stoke man nicks the ball back and clears the danger.

36: A half chance for Bojan after some good play from Berahino to maintain possession, with the former driving down the wing before trying his luck but again, it flies over Pickford's bar.

35: Rooney has done well to defend corners so far and he does so again as Shaqiri whips in an effort but the Everton forward gets ahead of Cameron to clear. 
Diouf tries his luck not long after but he lashes at the ball to send his shot wide. He had plenty of time to set himself up in the box but just doesn't use the advantage.

33: WIDE! It's not the best Rooney has ever produced as he sends the free kick well wide of the posts. A groan of frustration rings out around Goodison in what has been a game with little quality thus far.

32: Rooney cuts a frustrated figure as he twists and turns his way around his marker and is shouting for someone to pass it to, but no one was there to help.
Everton have the free kick now as Allen fouls Gueye. He needs to be careful after his recent booking. Rooney over the set piece.

29: First yellow card for Allen as he clips Rooney in the middle of the park. A couple of tasty tackles have been going in lately and it's the spark this game needs.


27: A good spell of possession from Everton as they look to create some chances with Stoke not seeing much of the ball in the last few minutes.
They have a throw-in now though as Jagielka plays an misplaced pass, which is unusual for him.


24: A good period for Everton as they win a corner, with Ramriez smashing an attempted cross into the backside of Zouma. Rooney lines it up.
SHOT! Phil Jagielka runs towards it and flicks the ball outwards to the top of the box, landing at the feet of Gueye who tries his luck but it fires well wide of the post.

21: STRIKE! A decent effort from Gueye as he collects the ball in the middle of the park and makes a little run to the top right corner of the box before going for goal himself and it's as decent a strike as we have seen so far, but Butland has it well covered. 

20: A decent passage of play between Rooney and Idrissa Gueye there as they knock the ball between themselves, looking for an opening. 
Gueye attempts to find Klaassen on his left but the ball runs too long for the midfielder and Stoke regain possession.

18: Everton are sitting incredibly deep at the moment as Stoke look to take control of this one. 
The Potters pass the ball between themselves before it lands at the feet of Shaqiri who attempts a run across the top of the box with a view to shooting, but Keane is tracking him all the way and the Stoke man doesn't quite manage an effort. 

16: Free kick to Stoke which Shaqiri delivers into the box. Joe Allen has a bite at the ball but sees his effort blocks before doing the same again. 
Ramriez then latches onto the loose ball and attempts to break with Davy Klaassen but the former is eventually flagged for offside. 

Right. It's time to bid farewell for today, and farewell for the Premier League for a fortnight. Many thanks for your company and look forward to seeing you on the other side of the international break.
Bye for now.

He looked frustrated on the bench - although there was also a hint of a smile at one point - and Sanchez has just posted a sombre photo on Instagram.

Jurgen Klopp gave much more of his time to the nation's media than Arsene Wenger. And was in fine form too.
Key lines:
"100 per cent Mignolet plays against Manchester City."
"Hope you enjoy the next five or six days – I’m not looking
forward to it."

It's mainly been about Arsenal so far, but let's not forget that Liverpool were quite impressive. Manager Jurgen Klopp has been saying as much in his interview with our Geoff Shreeves...
"We were very good, and so far we have learned from each game and built on it.
It was even better than against Hoffenheim, but it was already very good. There
was pressure on the boys and we wanted to show our desire to do something
special and the boys did very well.
“If
you give Arsenal time and space and opportunities then you’ve already lost
before the game starts. We had to learn to feel the pain in the game but to
ignore it.
"It was
overall a really good performance and well deserved. It’s very important the
clean sheet, with all the discussions about the defence. The result is the
result of the performance."

Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech: "It was quite simply unacceptable. You can come here and lose
4-0, that can happen on a bad day, but not like it happened today. We were not
fighting, we were not running enough and not winning any individual battles. 
"We
have only ourselves to blame. The only positive is that we have to respond and
we have time to respond because it’s early in the season."

Jamie Carragher has been pretty scathing in his assessment of Arsenal.
"It’s
the last 10 years, and you will see the same performances for the next 10 years
because there is a lack of ruthlessness from the top to the bottom. If we are
being honest, the board bottled the decision in the summer and were terrified of moving
the manager on.
"There had to be a change. Then the summer comes and it’s ‘things
may be different’…But what we saw today was worse. I called them cowards last
season and got a bit of criticism but I’ll say it again: cowards."

Theirry Henry says he turned his seat around in the studio at one point so he didn't have to watch the match.
"It
was unwatchable, at one point I wanted to leave. I don’t relate to the team and
I don’t think a lot of the fans do. That is a problem."

Short and sweet from Wenger in his press conference. Two
minutes, if that, before he was ushered away by the media man.
What went wrong?
"Everything. From the first to the last
minute. Technically, psychically – we were punished. The performance was not at
the requested level. It’s very difficult to answer. It’s not acceptable. We
were an easy opponent.”
And that was about it. He was asked on his way out about Oxlade-Chamberlain's future but wouldn't comment until the window has closed. Certainly left it open that the Ox could be on his way.

Arsene Wenger to Sky Sports: "The result is a consequence of our performance. We were not good
enough. We were beaten everywhere physically, in the end I believe we made it
easier for them, and the mistakes gave them a cushion.
"It
was shocking (the goal before half-time) but our performance was absolutely
disastrous. Not to become too emotional, we have to take some distance, and
there are some reasons behind it, and the players now go on their international
break, but we do have to take the consequences of our performance today.
"If
you find a manager who is happy with that performance today, I wish you good
luck. The emotions are negative, but it’s not the right moment to talk about
that. 
On
the fans booing: “I don’t want to answer that, that’s part of the crowd’s
feelings. If I am the problem, I am sorry, but I believe all together we lose.
The only thing we can do is come back and give them a better level of
performance."


Thierry Henry: "It’s painful. It's how they lose. It’s
always the same. You have seen it before. Everything you see reminds me of what
has happened for the last 10 years."


Graeme Souness is full of praise for Liverpool, before getting stuck into Arsenal.
"They were wishy-washy, weak-willed, pussy-footed, and
those are the nice things I can say about them. When they are at their worst
against a team who asks something of them they just wilt. It beggars belief
that players with Premier League experience make mistake after mistake. It’s
such basic stuff which could be put right quite easily."

I’ve made my way down to the Liverpool media centre and am
awaiting the arrival of Arsene Wenger and Jurgen Klopp for their post match press conferences. 
Trying to transcribe a
jubilant Klopp could be a test of my nimble fingers while Wenger surely will be
raging with his team after that showing. The away end looked incredibly
disgruntled as I strolled past. Don’t blame them.

Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson: "I thought we did very well. Arsenal had periods
with the ball but I always felt we were pretty solid and defended well as a
team. 
"On the break we were devastating. We are delighted with the performance.
I felt we controlled the game everywhere, we were brilliant and worked so
hard.
"As
the games have gone on, we’ve got better and better. The fitness levels have
been brilliant and a lot of that is down to pre-season."


More reaction coming up, but here's a look at the table heading into the international break.

Thierry Henry was not impressed with that performance.
"I’ve seen that movie before. You can lose at Anfield, but it’s
always the 'how' with Arsenal. We are always talking about desire and commitment.
The team that I came into could compete and fight. Where was the fight today?
Where was the tracking back and winning 50-50 balls? It’s just unacceptable what happened today."

That is that. Brilliant from Liverpool, dire from Arsenal.

90+1: SAVE! Salah gets in behind and hits a shot from a tight angle that Cech palms over.

90: Three minutes to be added on.

89: CHANCE! The free-kick is curled into the box towards Giroud, who rises well 12 yards out and heads well over the bar.

88: Lacazette wins a free-kick some 30 yards out, a chance for Arsenal to test Karius?

85: Arsenal are still yet to register a shot on target. Karius could not have asked for an easier afternoon.

83: Can, who has been quite brilliant in the last few games, is replaced by Grujic. There's been transfer speculation about Can this summer but surely Liverpool cannot let him leave.

82: Xhaka has a go from range but it's well off target. Sanchez, meanwhile, has a smile at something on the bench and then returns to a pensive/downbeat look.

80: Arsenal are going to face some serious questions after this performance. It's been so far below the required standard.
Meanwhile, Liverpool make a change as Firmino is replaced by Milner.

Comfortable. So, so comfortable for Liverpool. Firmino plays it out of his own half for Can, who slides it out to Salah on the left side of the box. He lofts over a cross to the back post where Sturridge is unmarked to head in.
Arsenal fans are heading for the exit.

77: Arsenal looking to go a little more aerial with Giroud and Lacazette up front, but they are not having too much success. 

74: A very warm ovation for Mane as he is replaced by Sturridge. 

73: Holding has not had a great few minutes. After a couple of poor touches he clatters Henderson late and gets booked.


70: CLOSE! Mane gets into the box and hits a shot which squirms past Cech and rolls goalwards, but Bellerin slides in to clear on the line.

69: Better from Arsenal as Giroud heads down a cross towards Lacazette. He strikes on the volley but it's blocked by three defenders.

68: Wijnaldum clips in a cross towards Salah but it's headed away. Arsenal look to break but get nowhere as Coquelin is tackled. No sign of a comeback from the Gunners yet.

65: The only negative for Liverpool so far has to be Karius' performance. He hasn't conceded but for the third time in the match he has just taken too long over a clearance and almost lost the ball.

63: It's Sanchez and Oxlade-Chamberlain who make way for Giroud and Lacazette for Arsenal. Is this Sanchez's last appearance for Arsenal? He cuts a very frustrated figure as he buries his head in his hands on the bench.

60: While Arsenal prepare a double change, Can has a shot from 25 yards that is blocked.

59: It has been this kind of day for Arsenal.

“Salah’s runs from minute one have been outstanding.
“He can’t take a touch there, Bellerin. Shambles from the
Arsenal man.”

Game, set and match? You'd think so.
Salah steals the ball from Bellerin after an Arsenal corner, bursts clear and runs into the box before sliding a shot past Cech. He had a look over his shoulder for support but decided to finish himself and it was the right decision.

55: CHANCE! Monreal caught in possession on halfway by Salah, who races clear, gets into the box and hits a shot across goal that Cech gets down to save.
Salah didn't manage to get the shot far enough into the corner.

54: Nothing comes from the corner and Moreno does well to stop Oxlade-Chamberlain breaking.

52: Mane wins a free-kick on the left corner of the box which is whipped in by Salah. Can flicks it on at the near post and it's almost met by Lovren in the middle. The referee gives a corner instead of a goal-kick.

50: What is Karius doing? He's had nothing to do but almost plays his team into trouble for the second time in the match as he takes too long over a clearance and is quickly closed down by Welbeck.

49: Ozil with a mistimed sliding tackle on Henderson. He doesn't catch him but the referee still brandishes the yellow card.

48: A few encouraging signs for Arsenal as they work it well down the left and then Sanchez cuts inside Henderson and hits a shot which is blocked.

46: Arsenal have gone to a back four, with Bellerin at right-back and Monreal on the left.
They almost create a chance as the ball breaks in the box but Ozil underhits a cross and then drags a shot wide.

No changes for Liverpool, and they get the game restarted.

Wenger has decided to make a change, with Coquelin on for Ramsey.

That's all we have from tonight's cracking Monday Night Football, many thanks for joining us. 
We'll be right back here at the weekend for the third round of Premier League fixtures. Until then, hit play on the video below to relive tonight's match.

Hear from Wayne Rooney following this evening's game.

Hear from Everton manager Ronald Koeman after the draw.

Hear from Man City manager Pep Guardiola following the match.


Ronaldo Koeman has just told Monday Night Football he wants to sign a new defender and another striker in addition to forwards Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Sandro Ramirez.
When asked if the club had finished spending, he said: "I hope not. We are looking for a left-footed central defender, maybe as back-up for Leighton Baines. With the injury to Funes Mori we don't have any left-footers on that side as a back-up for Leighton. That's an option.
"Also a striker because I think even with the talent of Dominic and Ramirez, look to other squads. They have that number of players. If we need to make the next step we need a striker in as well."



The England squad is being announced on Thursday, and could Wayne Rooney be back in?..  He was cryptic when asked by David Jones.
"We'll see. I'm just focused on Everton. I'll speak to Gareth Southgate over next few days, we'll have a conversation and see what happens."

Wayne Rooney is speaking to the Monday Night Football studio, and had this to say about the result.
"It's frustrating. It was 1-0 at half-time and with the extra man, we felt we could see game out, maybe get another goal but give City credit, they changed positions and made it difficult for us with some big chances. 
"Before the game, a point would have been good, but we are a bit frustrated."


Phew. It's all over guys, you can breathe now!
A busy, busy game that saw a 200th Premier League goal for Wayne Rooney swiftly followed by Kyle Walker's sending off just before the break. 
The second half was pretty fast and furious with a debut for Everton club record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson before Raheem Sterling levelled up for Man City with five minutes to play.
But that wasn't all as Morgan Schneiderlin was also given his matching orders late on for a second yellow card. Pep Guardiola was jumping around at full-time like his side had won, with friend Ronald Koeman decidedly more subdued. 
Stay tuned for match highlights in 15 minutes!

90+4: WHAT A TOUCH! What a spectacular touch from Klaassen as De Bruyne whips a ball into the box, searching for David Silva at the back post but the Dutchman gets a great high touch onto the ball to see it out for a corner. 
Sterling them pumps another ball into the box but Pickford collects ahead of Aguero.

90+3: This is end to end now as both look to take the win, with Besic and Calvert-Lewin breaking up one end but the latter cannot quite get the ball under control.
Man City then go down the other end and nearly score but no one can bury Sterling's fizzing cross. Do not take your eyes off this one!

90: Besic comes on for Rooney now, who is booed by the home fans for apparent time wasting. 
Four minutes added on.

88: RED CARD SCHNEIDERLIN! And just like that, the numbers are levelled up and it's a second yellow card for the Frenchman. 
Just like Walker's second yellow, it's a debatable booking as he challenges Aguero but replays appear to show he mostly gets the ball and catches the striker on the follow through who really foes make a meal of the tackle. 
Schneiderlin lets him know as he goes off the field with the two exchanging words, which I don't imagine are the nicest. 

86: A yellow card for Rooney now as the game really heats up in the final few minutes.

And there's the equaliser! It had been coming for a long, long time. 
It's a great cross into the box from Danilo but a suicidal header from Holgate who has done so well this evening, but it lands straight at the feet of Sterling. 
The England man makes no mistake in hitting it first time and it powers into the back of the net. Nothing Pickford can do about that and Everton have conceded their first goal this season.

82: CLEARED! Another foray into the box for City (sound familiar?. ) as Sterling bursts in from the right-hand side, attempting to cross for Bernardo Silva but an Everton body clears.

81: Shouts for a penalty from the home fans as Aguero goes to ground during a tussle with Baines, but he is leaping for a weighted Silva cross that he was never really going to make, while the Everton defender is just standing his ground. 
City would take anything now if it gave them a sight on goal. Pressure on.

79: SAVE! What a save from Pickford!! There are people all around him as Danilo flashes a ball into the box but the goalkeeper is down low for the save to keep the ball out. 
Aguero then goes to ground, but just outside the pitch after a challenge for Gueye before Everton break, and Calvert-Lewin in taken down by Kompany who takes the booking for his troubles.
The free kick delivery is headed on by Rooney but his effort is straight into the arms of Ederson.

77: NO RED CARD! Bobby Madley is surrounded by sky blue shirts as Otamendi goes to ground after a high challenge with Calvert-Lewin.
His fingers graze the defenders face but by his reaction, you'd think it was a full on punch, as the City players look for a red card but there's nothing from the referee. They're not happy, as you can imagine after Walker's earlier dismissal. 

76: WIDE! Another close chance for City as De Bruyne finds Aguero in the box who in turn takes one touch to put the ball into the path of Sterling in the middle.
The England international goes for goal but it just goes wide of the post. Very frustrated shouts from Sterling afterwards and the pressure is just cranking up for City now.

74: Huge shouts of derision from around the Etihad as Everton take their time for a throw in although to me, it didn't seem to be that much longer than a normal throw in really. 
WIDE! It's a great initial ball from Gueye to thread a pass for Calver-Lewin in between the defenders, but Ederson is out of his box to clear the ball.
It then lands to Rooney on the far right near the centre line and he tries to catch the goalkeeper out but it is well wide of the goal.

72: OVER! A long ranger from Sterling now as City still look for the equaliser, trying his luck from around 25 yards but it just goes over the crossbar. 

71: WIDE!! Some great work from Aguero there who has FOUR Everton shirts surrounding him as he twists and turns on the right of the box.
He somehow manages to get the ball to Bernardo Silva at the top of the box and he tries his luck on the volley but he shanks his effort and it bobbles wide of the post.

Time is running out for Man City to salvage anything from this game. They are 5/2 to draw and 9/1 to win while Everton are 4/9 to hold on for all three points.

69: Here comes that switch as Sane comes off for Bernardo Silva.

68: Not a bad run from De Bruyne as he attempts to find Aguero on the left of the box, but his pass is far too long for the striker and the ball runs wide.
Bernardo Silva being readied for Man City.

66: Second City change now as Danilo comes on for Stones.

65: BLOCKED! Another City foray into the box is blocked by the Everton back line as a marauding run from Aguero finds Silva to his right who in turn finds Sterling. 
The latter tries to power the ball through the box, but Jagielka chucks his bodies to the ground to stop another blue shirt reaching the ball.
Everton then break but Calvert-Lewin's right wing cross is saved by Ederson.

63: Free kick to Everton as Sterling clatters into Baines on the left touchline. It looked accidental from here but it's a free kick nonetheless on the far left.
Sigurdsson takes but Ederson is off his line to palm away the danger.

61: Here come those Everton changes with Gylfi Sigurdsson on for his debut along with fellow new signing Davy Klaassen. 
Williams and Davies are the men to make way. There are huge cheers from the away end for the Iceland international.

59: De Bruyne takes but it smashes into the wall - or more like into the ribs of Schneiderlin - as Silva also tries the follow up but it is also blocked. 
There is then a stop in play as Schneiderlin goes down winded, with a few minutes for him to recover himself. Meanwhile, this man is being prepared for his debut.

57: Free kick for Man City as Gueye dives in on Sterling. It's in a great position around 15 yards out. De Bruyne and Silva line it up with Sane nearby.

56: City have responded well in the second half and seen plenty of the ball, but they are yet to really make it count with some good defensive work from the visitors.
De Bruyne tries to lob a ball into the box for Aguero but Pickford collects with ease.

53: Another solid piece of defending from Holgate as he goes up against Sane this time on the left flank, but he again does well to pressure the City man into seeing the ball out for a corner.

51: More good defending from Everton as Aguero tries to shoot from the top of the box, but Keane is in the way to block the effort before the striker tries to latch onto the rebound down the left of the box but Holgate does well to see the ball out for a corner.

49: Huge boos from around the Etihad as Baines appears to play a back pass to Pickford as he goes in for a challenge on Sterling, with Pickford picking up the ball.
However, referee Bobby Madley believes it was the tackle that saw the ball back to Pickford rather than an intended back pass, and the home fans are not happy with the decision.  
Safe to say the referee is not popular around these parts at the moment.

46: Everton get the game back underway.

Man City are making a second half change with Raheem Sterling coming on for Jesus.
Meanwhile, Pep is still having words with the fourth official about the sending off. He did, at one point, turn his back on Michael Oliver to show him how he thought it happened but it won't help now.

Gary Neville had this to say on Kyle Walker's red card.
"I think the referee must think he (Walker) has elbowed him (Calvert-Lewin). The reality
is he hasn’t. Walker has a little look, which might count against him.
Calvert-Lewin has gone down and been clever. He’s held his head and it has conned the
referee."

Pre-match favourites Manchester City are now 9/2 to win after a nightmare first half. Everton are now 4/6 for all three points while the draw is 5/2.

Well, it was a fairly run of the mill first half of action until the 34th minute when David Silva hit the post - then it all got a bit bonkers.
Everton lead thanks to Wayne Rooney's second goal in two Premier League games - and his 200th in the competition - before Kyle Walker was given his marching orders for two yellow cards in two minutes.
Perhaps the second was a bit harsh but he's off nonetheless and City are down to ten men for the second 45 minutes.

45: RED CARD WALKER! Walker is off for a second yellow. Oh dear, oh dear, his home debut for Man City ends in a very early shower as he is giving his marching orders just before the break. 
He seems to back into Calvert-Lewin although he cannot really see him so it's not entirely clear how much he knows about it. But Bobby Madley instantly goes for the second yellow card as the Everton player goes to ground, and it results in a sending off.
Walker and Pep Guardiola are remonstrating with Michael Oliver as he looks to make his way off but there's not changing the decision now. City now down to ten men. 
Two minutes added on.

44: Some great defending from Everton in recent minutes as Baines flies into a challenge on Walker on the edge of the box but any appeals for a penalty are waved away.
Pickford is then in action as he saves from Jesus' effort, which he controls with his chest before striking but it's not enough to beat the Everton goalkeeper

43: OUCH! It's a cruncher from Walker as he flies into a challenge on Baines and it's a yellow card for the Man City man. 
Meanwhile, England manager Gareth Southgate is in the crowd tonight along with assistant manager Steve Holland. Remember, eight English players in the Everton XI this evening!

40: The goal has done little to effect the flow of the game as City look to get back level before the break.
There is a half penalty shout as Jesus goes down in the box after a tackle from Keane, but nothing is given by Bobby Madley.

You can tell Rooney enjoyed that and they have stunned the City fans who were still reeling from Silva hitting the post!
It's great play down the right flank between Holgate and Calvert-Lewin, with the latter the one to slide the ball into the feet of Rooney in the middle of the box to strike.
Ederson almost gets down low to save but it's not quite good enough as he ball slides underneath him and hits the back of the net.
Rooney's 200th Premier League goal, ladies and gents.

34: OFF THE POST! The momentum is truly swinging the way of City now and the crowd can sense it. 
Aguero picks out Silva on the left of the box and he goes for goal but it smashes off the post and goes wide. 


Two goals from two substitutes in Marcus Rashford and Marouane Fellaini late in the day win it for United and overall, they deserved the victory. 
Credit must go to Kasper Schmeichel though who kept the scoreline from being even higher, culminating in a superb save from a Romelu Lukaku penalty. 
But Manchester United continue their 100 per cent start with three victories and three clean sheets, plus a whopping ten goals. They remain top of the Premier League. 

90+4: CLOSE! Almost the icing on the cake for United as Lukaku goes for goal on the right of the box, but his shot chips over the goalkeeper and the bar.
Schmeichel is shown a late yellow card just before Michael Oliver blows the full-time whistle.

90+3: SAVE! What a cross from Gray on the left and King is waiting to just tap it home but De Gea reads it superbly at the near post and gets down low to keep the Welshman out.

90: Four minutes added on.

89: Free kick to United as James clips Rashford, and earns himself the yellow card in the process. It's nearly a great delivery to Lukaku at the back post but Fuchs does well to see the ball away.

88: Half penalty shouts as Simpson bursts into the box from the right, with Blind making the challenge but there's no spot kick for the visitors. 

Another sub, another goal and United have probably sealed the win now. 
It's a superb run from Lingard into an acre of space on the left flank as he collects a pass, and manages to hold the ball long enough to wait for back up before shooting. 
When he does, his effort is guided into the back of the net by the knee of Fellaini, although there are some queries over whether he was onside or not. It stands though and a second for the hosts.

81: A nice spot from Valencia as he tries to thread the ball into the feet of Rashford and play him through, but Schmeichel is off his line to collect down low. Otherwise, it could have been a brace for the United forward. 

80: Leicester are doing well as we head towards a conclusion at Old Trafford and are having their best spell of attack, but they just cannot find an opening just yet. 

78: A good ball from Ndidi there as he picks out Slimani on the right of the box, but Jones is tracking him and manages to head the ball away with ease. 

76: Another United change as Jesse Lingard comes on for Martial. A decent game from the Frenchman who gets a huge round of applause from the home fans and a standing ovation. 
Leicester make a change too with Islam Slimani coming on for Vardy.


75: WIDE! It's the two big boys up against each other with Lukaku v Morgan as the former strides towards goal and he goes for goal, but his effort is high and wide over the crossbar. Not his best. 

74: A few minutes after picking up his assist, Mkhitaryan goes off with Marouane Fellaini coming on to replace him.

Super sub to the rescue! The late goals start now and it took Rashford three minutes and 18 seconds to put United ahead who have deserved it based on the game overall.
A corner is put into the box by Mkhitaryan and Rashford is just left in the middle of the box with no one marking him. It's a great tap home but far too simple from a Foxes point of view - someone needs to be on him. 
Nothing they can do now though and United are ahead.

67: CLOSE! What a player Mahrez is as he is set away down the right flank, going one-on-one with Blind. There's only one winner though as he leaves the Dutchman for dust before firing in a cross, but no one else is there to convert. 
Meanwhile, United make their first change with Rashford coming on for Mata.

65: Leicester show off what they do best as they hit United on the counter-attack, with Gray bursting through the middle of the park before laying the ball of to Mahrez on the right. 
Jones does well to block the Algerian's cross before Vardy powers an effort wide. 

63: More pressure from Man Utd after a brief spell where Leicester looked to be creating chances. Another cross is put into the box but Schmeichel is there again to collect. 

60: Double change for Leicester as Albrighton and Okazaki are replaced by Andy King and Demarai Gray.

59: Nearly a great move for United as Mata flcisk a ball back into the box from the base line which Mkhitaryan nearly latches on to, but his touch is too hard and the ball runs wide.
WIDE! At the other end, Mahrez dances through the box like a hot knife through butter, getting away from Jones, but the United defender eventually catches up to poke the ball wide.

57: SAVE! The first real save De Gea has had to make this game as Leicester work the ball well around the box, with Mahrez hitting a low, hard shot from the right-hand side but the goalkeeper is down low to push it away from danger. 

55: First booking of the match for Mkhitaryan as he fouls Mahrez in the middle of the park. Leicester have the free kick and try to create an opportunity but nothing materialises. 
NO FOUL! Schmeichel pumps a ball down the field, searching for Albrighton who nearly gets there, but a shove in the back from Bailly puts him on the floor. Nothing given by Michael Oliver. Peculiar. 

Live Manchester United v Leicester Price Boosts.

53: SAVED!!!! Schmeichel saves from Lukaku! An almighty save from the Leicester goalkeeper who has been nothing short of outstanding this evening, leaping to his right to keep out the striker. 

52: PENALTY UNITED! Well well well, what a situation we have here. Mere seconds after one handball shout on Maguire was waved away by Michael Oliver, Simpson is penalised for the ball hitting his hand in the box. 
The Leicester defender cannot believe the decision as Lukaku puts the ball on the spot. 

51: NO PENALTY! Shouts from around Old Trafford as Lukaku goes down just inside the box after a tussle with Maguire, but it looked like a fair challenge from here and Michael Oliver waves away the calls. 

50: Much like the first, United are seeing all of the ball in the Leicester half. I don't think the visitors have even been out of it yet with five minutes gone. 

48: A fairly quiet opening to the second half, with a back pass from Mkhitaryan to Lukaku outside the box well cleared by the Leicester defence.
There's also a famous face in the stands today.  

46: Leicester get the game back underway!


A very physical first half at Old Trafford with Man Utd having the better of the possession and chances but they are yet to make them count. 
But the hosts have scored their goals late on this season so far, with plenty of time left to go in this one.

45: One minute added on at the end of the first half.

44: Free kick to united as Mata is fouled by Albrighton, just seconds after Bailly's challenge on Okazaki was deemed legal by Michael Oliver. 
United don't make a huge chance for their advantage, but they are continuing to squeeze around the Foxes box. You feel it is only a matter of time before a goal comes their way.

42: A sublime switch of flank for Pogba there as he picks out Blind on the left hand side with a great pass, which the Dutchman delivers into the box. 
Lukaku gets a head to the delivery but he cannot get it on target as the Leicester defence clear. 

41: A rare passage of play around the United box for Leicester as Albrighton pumps a ball into the box, searching for Vardy but De Gea reads it well - again - and collects. 

39: A brief stop in play as Fuchs appears to have picked up a head injury after going up for a high challenge with Valencia. The medical team are on to make sure he's OK.
The Austrian is back on his feet and it looks like he'll continue.

38: Not the best free kick from United and the wall does it's job as Pogba's effort clatters into the Leicester defenders before Schmeichel collects the loose ball. 

37: Free kick to United in a very dangerous spot as Maguire is judged to have fouled Lukaku around 20 yards out. To be fair, he did have his arms all over him.
Three over it in Pogba, Mkhitaryan and Mata.  

35: SAVE! Pogba is probing for a goal and goes from the cross-come-shot from the left of the box but Schmeichel is out to push it away. 
SHOT! Guess who? Yep, the Frenchman is trying from distance again now and it's not a bad effort, but the ball flashes wide of the post. 
Six shots and one on target for Pogba so far.

34: A good touch there from Morgan as Martial slides Mkhitaryan in down the left of the box and he seems to be nearly through on goal, but a toe on the ball from the Leicester skipper just takes it away from United midfielder as the home side win the corner. 

32: OUCH! Simpson and Jones give us a Mayweather v McGregor preview as the Man Utd defender clatters into the Foxes full-back near the edge of the Leicester area.
Jones comes off worse and it calling for a free kick, but Michael Oliver waves play on. Jose Mourinho is also unamused with the challenge, but United get nothing for their protests. 

31: Some more good play from Mkhitaryan there as he slides in Martial who makes his way into the 'D' bfore striking - but it is well saved by Schmeichel who gets down low.

30: WIDE! A good run from Martial down the left flank as he takes on the Leicester defenders and picks out Pogba again at the top of the box.
However, the Man Utd midfielder again fires his effort way over the crossbar but he is finding himself in increasingly good positions at the edge of the area. Eventually, you feel he'll make it count.

28: Not the best from Pogba there as he plays a lovely one-two with Mkhitaryan, and he tries to chip the ball into the back of the net but instead finds the top of it. He knows that wasn't his finest chance.


It was a tight call to deny Mata, maybe he had a foot offside. ?

25: WIDE! Another shot from Lukaku, this time from range and it's a thunderbolt strike, but it just swings past Schmeichel's upright. The Leicester goalkeeper is scrambling though.

23: Pretty good play from Vardy there as he pokes the ball into the path of Okazaki with two red shirts surrounding him, and the Japan international tries his luck but it flashes wide.

21: CLOSE!! Inches away for Pogba! He is set up by Martial's cross on the right side of the box and tries to slot home at the back post, but he slips as he shoots and it wriggles agonisingly past the post. 
SAVE! Mata is then at it again , dancing his way into space in the box as he attempts to break the deadlock but Schmeichel is there again to keep the Spaniard out. Manchester United can smell blood now with Leicester defending very, very deep.


That's all we have from Stamford Bridge today, many thanks for joining us. 
You can head here to keep up with all of the 3pm Premier League action and don't forget to be back here from 5.15pm to see the match highlights. 
See you then!

Jamie Redknapp says you cannot underestimate how important Chelsea's win over Watford is for Antonio Conte's side.


Today's victory takes Chelsea above Watford into fourth place ahead of the 3pm kick offs.

Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has been speaking to Sky Sports following the game.  
"I think our performance was good. It is not simple when you concede a goal in the last minute of the first half. And then we conceded again
in the second half and I think our confidence was low. But my players showed a good will
to fight and change their situation and final result."

Watford manager Marco Silva has been speaking to Sky Sports following the game.  
"It is a really unfair result. It didn’t reflect the game on the pitch. It
didn’t reflect how we played, and how we came here and controlled for most of
the match."


Alan Pardew has been giving his thoughts to Simon Thomas following Chelsea's win. 
"The subs changed it today. Not just Batshuayi, but Willian as well. It will give the manager a bit of confidence after that."


A thoroughly entertaining game at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea have their first win in three games. 
Pedro opened the scoring with a truly superb strike, before Doucoure levelled up for Watford on the stroke of half-time. 
Pereyra then put the visitors ahead just four minutes after the restart, but Batshuayi got Chelsea back on level terms with 20 minutes to play.
He and Azpilicueta then scored late on to seal the victory for the hosts. The scoreline arguably flatters them a little bit, with Watford really going toe-to-toe with the Premier League champions this afternoon.

There's the final act of the game most likely and Chelsea add another at the death. 
It's a poor, poor pass from Britos that Bakayoko blocks, into the path of Batshuayi in the box. Kabasele tries to muscle the striker off the ball but he stays strong to poke home under Gomes.
Four goals in three games against Watford for Batshuayi now and three points for Chelsea.

90+4: A bit of cheekiness from the crowd towards Gomes there as Watford have a free kick. They don't appear to be giving it back to him, although the ball does eventually appear. 
The Watford players are around Jon Moss but they just watch on as Gomes - with ball in hand - makes his way back onto the field. 

90+3: Chelsea just seeing the clock down now as they win a deep free kick. Watford have been superb today though, can they snatch a draw?

90: Five minutes added on. 

89: Another Watford change now as Gray replaces Mariappa. Silva is going for this one. 

They've only gone and done it!!! Sort of.  There's stuill a way to go yet, but Chelsea retake the lead.
It's a superb ball from the right from Willian, which misses the head of Batshuayi but Azpilicueta is waiting at the back post to head home. 
He kisses the badge in his celebration while Conte throws himself into the crowd. Not entirely unusual from him, to be fair. 

86: Final change from Chelsea as Zappacosta comes on for Pedro. A fine goal from him in the first half. 
CLOSE!! A superb first contribution from Zappacosta who fires in a great ball from the right flank, which Batshuayi is busting a gut to meet but it just runs wide. 

85: A decent cross into the box from Femenia, but it misses the head of Kabasele and the foot of Richarlison before running wide.

82: CLOSE! It's an interesting delivery from Fabregas as he slides the ball down the far side for the waiting Batshuayi, who latches onto it and goes for goal, but it just skims past the post. 

81: Free kick to Chelsea as Hazard is nicked by Watson as he tries to surge forward. Fabregas over it.

80: CLOSE!! A great nick from Fabregas in the middle of a melee to set Batshuayi off towards the box. He goes a bit early though, letting fly from the top of the area as it just goes past the post.
A Watford change now as Deeney comes off for Watson. Is Silva looking to protect the point?

78: Yellow for Femenia as he kicks the ball away. A silly booking for any player, really.

77: CLOSE! Could Chelsea have snuck a goal there! Fabregas picks out the run of Willian who tries to burst forward from the middle of Watford's half. 
The pass just misses him but he goes one on one with Gomes in the box as they both chase down the loose ball, but the goalkeeper pounces before any damage is done. 
The offside flag is also raised so any goal wouldn't have counted.

75: Somehow, both Luiz and Cahill have ended up on the deck after trying to mark Kabasele in the box, both also clutching their hamstrings.
They get up and limp around a bit before carrying on. 


74: Just after the restart, and Watford win a free kick on the far right after a foul from Bakayoko.
It's delivered by Holebas, and Carillo meets it at the back post but Courtois makes a good save to keep his effort at bay.

Famous last words over here! Chelsea really needed that and Batshuayi once again scores against Watford. 
Willian picks out Pedro on the right flank, with the Spaniard in turn floating the most inviting of balls into the box, which Batshuayi rises to meet and fires a bullet header into the back of the net. 
It's a great goal from the Blues but can they find the winner?

70: Groans around Stamford Bridge as Batshuayi is too easily dispossessed by Kabasele at the top of the box. You have to say, Watford are in control here. 

68: Another Chelsea change as Alonso makes away for Willian. Attacking substitutions so far from Conte. 

67: CLOSE! Another missed chance from Richarlison as Carillo bursts away down the right flank before whipping a low cross in for his team-mate.
Richarlison gets to it, but with Azpilicueta coming in with the tackle from behind, he slices his shot which goes wide. 

65: Here comes the change as Carillo enters the field after Watford win yet another corner when the initial effort was cleared. 
The second attempt takes a bit longer for the hosts to sort their feet out and really get it away, but they do manage to do so eventually.

64: Play gets back underway after Pereyra takes his time to leave the field, and it looks like Carillo will come on in his place.
Watford briefly down to ten men, though as the corner is taken.

63: This isn't looking good for Pereyra who sits down in the box after a tussle with Fabregas on the base line. He looks to have done his ankle some mischief and the medical team are on to take a look. 

62: Watford win the free kick after Deeney is fouled in the middle of the half. 
Holebas delivers, but does not beat the first man who manages to head away.

61: Not a bad move from Chelsea as Hazard gets away down the right flank before picking out Fabregas in the box, but his attempt to cross is muscled out by the Watford defenders.
Meanwhile, Chelsea do make a change with Batshuayi coming on for Morata. 

59: Watford are oozing confidence now and are dealing well with anything Chelsea are trying to throw at them. Time for some changes, perhaps?


56: Another card from Jon Moss as Morata is booked for a foul. Watford do not make much from the free kick, though.

55: CLOSE! Nearly another for Watford!! It's a great hooked pass into the box from Britos on the right, meeting the head of an almost unmarked Richarlison in the middle but he cannot direct his header into the back of the net.
Another sitter missed by the Watford man.


There's no mistaking this time and Watford are cruising at the start of this second half!
It's a superb pass from Richarlison on the left of the box after a lay off from Deeney, finding Pereyra in space near the back post and he makes no mistake in firing home, over the body of Courtois. 
A superb start to the second half from Watford. 

49: CHANCE!!!! Wow, how has Richarlison missed that?! It's a superb cross into the box for Femeina and Richarlison has got into a sea of space at the back post.
All he has to do is poke it home but somehow, he misses for mere yards. A huge chance missed for Watford.

48: A fast start continues as Watford break down the other end but a cross from Deeney is cut out by Azpilicueta - before Cleverley hilariously misses his kick of the ball - before Pedro fires a shot just wide of the top corner. 

47: CLOSE!! How about an own goal to start off the first half? Well, that's almost what happened to Watford as Mariappa's clearance from an Azpilicueta cross just skims across the open goal and onto the top of the net. Close from the visitors. 

46: Watford get the game back underway at Stamford Bridge. 

Former Crystal Palace and West Ham manager Alan Pardew is watching the game in the Sky Sports studio this afternoon, and gave his verdict on Watford's first half performance. 
"Watford have played with a confidence and air about them. They've made it difficult for Chelsea."

Chelsea were 1/3 at 0-0 and 1/10 at 1-0, but they're now 8/11 after that blow on the stroke of half-time. Watford are into 6/1 to complete a famous double having seen off Arsenal from a similar position last week, while the draw is 2/1. There's also a Price Boost - Britos to be carded at an enhanced 9/4.

An entertaining half of football and a great finish as Doucoure's fierce strike cancels out Pedro's stunning opener. 
Watford are proving once again that they are a team to be matched while Chelsea have let another lead slip. An interesting first half on the way!

And Watford get back into it on the stroke of half time! It's another fine goal, too. 
Holebas delivers a long throw-in with almost the last action of the half, which is initially headed away by Luiz, but the rebound falls to the feet of Doucoure who hammers the ball through the box and into the back of the net. 
It's a great strike and a good end to the half from Watford.

45+1: Another good free kick position for Watford as Luiz is penalised for a foul on Richarlison, just on the left of the box. 
Holebas is over it.  
It's a good delivery but it flashes through the packed box before Bakayoko manages to hack it away. 

That concludes our coverage from the Emirates Stadium, where Arsenal proved too strong for Brighton as a 2-0 victory lifted them to fifth in the Premier League. Be sure to key across the Sky Sports platforms for reaction, and the rest of Sunday’s games – we’ve just got underway at Goodison Park.


Arsenal: Cech (6), Holding
(6), Mustafi (6), Monreal (7), Bellerin (6), Xhaka (6), Ramsey (7), Kolasinac
(6), Iwobi (7), Sanchez (8), Lacazette (7).
Subs: Walcott (5), Giroud
(5), Elneny (4).
Brighton: Ryan (7), Bruno
(6), Dunk (7), Duffy (8), Bong (6), Izquierdo (6), Stephens (6), Propper (6), March
(6), Gross (6), Brown (4).
Subs: Knockaert (5),
Schelotto (5), Murray (6).
Man of the Match: Alexis Sanchez


The Chile international put in a fine display against
Brighton as he set the tempo for the majority of Arsenal’s attacks. His fine
back-heel for Iwobi's goal highlighted the quality Arsenal's star winger has,
while he was unlucky not to have a goal of his own following Dunk's excellent
block off the line.


It's all over at the Emirates where Arsenal seal an assured 2-0 victory to move up to fifth in the Premier League, level with champions Chelsea. Nacho Monreal and Alex Iwobi got the goals for Arsene Wenger's men, Alexis Sanchez the star man for the Gunners with a special assist for the hosts' second.

90+3: CLOSE! Walcott's deflected cross finds Sanchez on the left, and his volley lands on Giroud's head, but his effort flashes just over the bar.

90+2: There will be THREE minutes of added time at the Emirates.

87: CLOSE! Brighton ever so close to reducing the deficit as a wicked ball into the area to flicked behind by Mustafi, just before Murray get his head on it.

84: CHANCE! Gross whips a cross into the Arsenal area where Murray steals a march on his marker at the near post, but his header nestles in the side-netting. The majority of the away end at the Emirates thought that one was in!

82: SUB! Third and final change for Arsenal as Xhaka makes way for Elneny. 

80: Brighton players surround Bellerin as they hunt for possession in Arsenal territory, but Murray is penalised for bundling the wing-back to ground.

76: SUBS! Double change for Brighton as Knockaert and Murray replaced Izquierdo and Brown.

76: Sanchez dusts himself down to take the resulting free-kick, but it sails over the target.

75: Sanchez races forward from midfield, holding off two Brighton players before Dunk brings the Chilean to ground.


71: SUBS! Double change for Arsenal as Iwobi and Lacazette make way for Walcott and Giroud, meaning Lacazette's goalscoring run at the Emirates has come to an end. Brighton, meanwhile, have brought on Schelotto for March.


67: CHANCE! Lacazette is released in behind the Brighton defence but Dunk recovers with a perfectly-timed block just before the Frenchman let fire.

65: Sanchez has really come alive in this second half. He shows great footwork to get away from Brighton's midfield shield, and then plays a one-two with Iwobi, but his toe-poked effort drifts wide.

62: OFF THE LINE! From the resulting corner, Kolasinac's goal-bound header is cleared off the line by Dunk before Sanchez draws Ryan into another low save. If it wasn't for the Seagulls stopper Arsenal would be out of sight.

61: SAVE! Sanchez is given acres of space down the left, and he almost makes Brighton pay as he skips inside Bruno and draws Ryan in to a fine save low to his left.

59: Brighton players stand off Sanchez, inviting him to shoot from distance, which he does, but his dipping effort is blocked before it reaches the target.

Ryan's defences are breached for a second time as Alex Iwobi gets in on the act. Iwobi provides a clinical finish, high over Ryan, but the credit goes to Alexis Sanchez, who plays the ball off Lacazette and Ramsey before delightfully back-heeling the ball into Iwobi's path.

54: SAVE! Sanchez chips a deft ball over the top of the Brighton defence which finds Ramsey, but, again, Ryan is on hand to make the save for the visitors.

52: Sanchez floats a corner out to Ramsey on the edge of the Brighton area, but the Welshman's technique is found wanting as he volleys way over the target.

49: BLOCK! Lacazette comes alive in side the Brighton area, getting away from Dunk before firing a first-time shot towards goal, but Duffy is on hand with a last-gasp block.

47: Sanchez plays a neat one-two with Ramsey but then hands possession back to Brighton as his lofted poss drifts aimlessly out for a goal kick.

KICK-OFF! Brighton get the second half underway!


Arsenal are 1/16 to convert for maximum points here, with Sanchez 5/1 to score the second goal. It's 9/2 that the Gunners win 3-0 and 11/1 for Lacazette to score a header, while those spying a fightback can back Brighton at 66/1.

The referee calls time on a rather entertaining first half at the Emirates. Nacho Monreal's second Premier League goal separates the two sides but there could, and probably should, have been more as Lacazette and March struck the post and an inspired display from Mathew Ryan kept Arsenal at bay. 

45+1: There will be ONE minute of added time played.

45: CHANCE! Izquierdo bundles his way into the Arsenal area, bullying Mustafi before cutting the ball back to Propper, who curls an effort wide from tough angle.

42: CHANCE! Cech flaps at a corner again but Arsenal recover before hitting Brighton with a devastating counter. No more than five Gunners flood forward as Bellerin plays the ball out to Kolasinac and he cuts it back for Ramsey. The Welshman is set to stroke the ball home but up pops Ryan with another fine save!

39: YELLOW! Sanchez shows great skill and pace to switch direction in an instant, and he's just too quick for Duffy who catches him with a late challenge. That's a booking all day long.

37: As has been the case with the majority of the first half, Arsenal have all of the possession and Brighton are penned in to their half, but the hosts' possession is all in front of the visitors, who are holding firm.

34: CHANCE! Brighton so nearly shoot themselves in the foot as Dunk's mis-control presents Lacazette with the ball 25 yards from goal. The Frenchman bears down on the area but he doesn't get enough power in shot as Ryan saves again.

32: Arsenal win a free-kick 25 yards from goal but Xhaka is unable to get an effort on target as the Brighton wall does its job.

28: Iwobi carries the ball from deep and shows great strength to fend off Stephens, but his tame effort is gathered with ease by Ryan.

26: Brighton whip a corner into the Arsenal area which Cech flaps at, and then Bellerin allows it to drift behind for another corner. The Gunners aren't punished though, with Brighton unable to create an opening.

23: OFF THE POST! It's Brighton's turn to hit the woodwork as a short free-kick catches Arsenal asleep. The ball is rolled to March who let's fly from 20 yards, thundering the ball against the post, before Dunk fires the rebound wide. Incredible!

Nacho Monreal gave Arsenal a deserved lead in the 16th minute with a composed finish.

Izquierdo breaks down the left, cuts inside and drills an inch-perfect out to Propper, who lures a cheap foul from Kolasinac. Can Brighton find a response from this set piece?

19: March breaks down the right flank and delivers a great ball into the area which Propper comes within inches of turning on target as Arsenal turn the ball out for a corner.
17: YELLOW! Gross has been booked, not quite sure what for!

Arsenal make the breakthrough from an unlikely source as Nacho Monreal grabs only his second Premier League goal for the club. The Spaniard is in the right place at the right time in the penalty area to drill the ball home after Mustafi and Bellerin see their attempts blocked by Brighton.

15: After some intricate play in between the deep-lying Brighton defence, Lacazette draws a foul from Bong on the right flank.

13: SAVE! Arsenal dominate possession for a couple of minutes before releasing Iwobi down the left channel, and the forward's low first-time effort draw Ryan into a decent save.

9: Alexis Sanchez is walking around rather gingerly having picked up a knock. I don't doubt for a minute that it'll lead to him going off, though.

Well, that was fun. The Premier League just keep on delivering amazing football matches. Stay tuned across our platforms for all the reaction. Thanks for joining.


“To see this atmosphere was great. It’s a fantastic stadium –
it’s amazing for the opponent.
“Despite 70,000 Tottenham fans, in this atmosphere, our fans
tried to push the same.” 

“David Luiz played very well. It was an amazing performance.
He played with great experience and personality – he was a point of reference
for other players. We had four new players. When you change two players with Christensen
and Rudiger – it’s not easy for them. We showed great desire to stay compact
and not lose balance. We are the champions."

“Thanks to our fans. It was an incredible atmosphere. Great
to play in this atmosphere. The fans were important. They pushed us in every
moment when we was suffering.”

“I want to thank my players. They showed me great desire,
great will, great heart. A will to fight. I saw the fighters. I saw a lot of positive
things in not an easy moment with injuries and suspensions – don’t forget that.
It’s a fantastic result."

Let's see what he has to say..

Tottenham's woes at Wembley continued with a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in their first league game at their temporary home.
READ HERE

Marcos Alonso and David Luiz hailed Chelsea's character after bouncing back from defeat at Burnley..

And with that, Pochettino scoots back out of the Wembley press conference room. Now, we wait for Conte.

Can they compete?
"Yes, of course. We are in a better position than last season.
We play one step higher than last season. I’m not worried about the team." 

“It doesn’t affect me. But I understand. We need to talk about
it – Wembley is not the reason we lost. We played very well. It’s not fair to
blame Wembley – it’s one of the best places in the world to play football.
“Wembley wasn’t the problem. We played better with the size
of the pitch. We need to be more clinical. We created enough opportunities. We
will win a lot of games in the future.”

“We deserved more. I’m happy with the performance. We
created the most chances. They were clinical. It was difficult to score for us.
“We were much better than Chelsea. They tried to contain us
and play on the counter. I’m very happy. We were a little unlucky. I’m not
upset or frustrated. If you lose in that way, I’m happy.” 

The Spurs manager is in the house for his press conference..


"They reacted to the defeat last week like a big team. They
came out, they were disciplined and very clinical against one of their biggest
rivals." 

I've made my way down to the depths of Wembley and am awaiting arrival of Mr Conte and Mr Poch. 
Contrasting emotions, I'd have thought from both managers. We'll bring you all the best lines.


"When you work really hard as a team and the effort is right, you get your rewards."

Chelsea only had two shots on target.

They were hoping the phrase 'Wembley hoodoo' wouldn't be needed.



FT: THERE IS THE WHISTLE! Chelsea have won it!!
Spurs didn't lose at home last season, but they've lost the first game at their temporary ground. Two goals from  Alonso - the second of which should have been saved by  Lloris two minutes from time - earn the points, despite Spurs levelling through Batshuayi's own goal.

90+ 4: The ball is in the corner - and Chelsea win a corner. Chelsea are on the brink.

90+2: Spurs launch it long, but Chelsea will deal with that all day long. Kante brings the ball away as Chelsea run down the clock.

90: We will have FOUR additional minutes. Can Spurs salvage something?

Praise for David Luiz.  but not for the Spurs goalkeeper!
"That is a famous goal. That man and the fans behind the goal are going absolutely mental. There is a fantastic piece of play from Luiz to win the ball back.
"Lloris should save it. Save it with your feet. Save it with your hands. Do something. You cannot let that go in at your near post."

UNBELIEVABLE! 
With Chelsea on the back-foot, they break. Batshuayi breaks through and appeals for a penalty off Dembele. Nothing given. Spurs give the ball away and Alonso gets in down the left. Spurs seem well set and Alonso fires a tame effort at Lloris. but it slips under his body. Shocker. The away end erupt.

86: Only look one winners now. It's the home team. Eriksen fires another tasty ball into the box and it almost drops to Vertonghen at the back stick, who was shaping to volley. Chelsea clear. 

Eriksen fires in ANOTHER fantastic ball. A Chelsea player is first to it, but the sub looks a bit sleepy as he bullets a header past his own goalkeeper. Sloppy from the striker - but it was a brilliant ball from the Great Dane. Batshuayi can't believe what he's just done.
All square. This place has come ALIVE!

Gary Neville says the scoreline is a little harsh on the home team.
"In the first 20 minutes, Spurs were caught a little bit by surprise by Chelsea's tactics. But since then they have played really well. I have to say Chelsea have defended well too - and credit to them."

81: Silly foul given away by Bakayoko about 22 yards out, down the left. Eriksen to whip this one in..

80: SUB! Davies off. Sissoko on. Spurs going for broke now.

78: SUBS! Chelsea make a double change. Pedro and Batshuayi on. Morata and Willian off. Like for like. Big 12 minutes here.

75: End to end now. Tottenham on the charge. Eriksen has an effort blocked. Kane has an effort blocked. And Alli can't quite reach a Eriksen centre. Super defending from the three Chelsea centre-backs. 

Gary Neville says Tottenham's first substitution has swung the momentum in CHELSEA'S favour.
"Dier going off has changed this game. All of a sudden, Tottenham aren't maintaining attacks. Now Chelsea are punching out through them and counter-attacking."

73: POST!!! Chelsea are doing all the pressing. Willian finds space after a nice break from Bakayoko. He's about 20 yards out and pings a low effort that's aimed for the bottom corner. It comes back off the woodwork and to safety!

70: CHANCE!! Chelsea look a threat on the break. Willian does fantastically to sprint past three Spurs defenders. He releases Morata in behind, who tries - obviously it has to be said - to get it onto his right foot. He does so but his effort from 15 yards is deflected wide. 
71: SHOT!! From the corner, Moses emerges with the ball on the right edge. He smacks one which forces Lloris to dive. but it zips over the crossbar.


Pedro is preparing to come on, wearing a protective mask following a pre-season collision with David Ospina.

67: SUB! Chelsea get out of their half! Willian drives forward but Davies makes a fine tackle. Dier is coming off. Son is on. 
69: SHOT! Are Tottenham running out of ideas? They work the ball across to Wanyama about 25 yards out. He takes a swing but shanks it well wide.

Chelsea are doing what not many teams could do away at Tottenham last season.

64: Alli wins another corner down the right off Luiz. 
Davies comes across to swing one in with his left. It's another super ball but Morata is there again to head clear. Brilliant defending.

61: Nice tricks from Alli down the left flank win a foul off Kante. 
Eriksen whips a ball into the middle but Morata is back there to muck in. He heads clear. Very Costa-like indeed.

Gary Neville thinks it'll be 10 minutes before Poch makes a change. Jamie Redknapp reckons Wanyama may be the man to make way when the change comes. But what will the Tottenham manager decide to do?

59: PENALTY APPEAL. NOT GIVEN! Great run from Alli. He chips the ball over Moses and then tries to find Kane in the middle. Azpilicueta makes the block with the top of his arm. Spurs cry for a pen. the referee says NO WAY!

Jamie Redknapp doesn't think Spurs need to change anything just yet.
"It's a pulsating game. What options has Pochettino got? Would I be tempted to roll the dice? Probably not. I think he can get something out of the game with the 11 on the pitch."

54: Spurs try to keep the pressure high. Alderweireld takes man and ball on a challenge with Willian. Kane then tries to play Alli in behind but Azpilicueta mops up.
56: A ball in behind finds Trippier bursting past Alonso for the first time. He sends in a low first-time cross but it's hooked clear by Christensen under pressure from Kane.



FT: Leicester somehow left the Vitality Stadium with a point after a goalless draw this afternoon, despite Bournemouth dominating from start to finish.
Eddie Howe’s
side had numerous chances to break the deadlock on the South Coast, but a
combination of poor finishing and a controversial missed penalty prevented them
from securing a much-needed three points.
Bournemouth
will rightly point to an early penalty appeal that was turned down by Graham
Scott after Danny Simpson handled March Pugh’s goal-bound shot.
As a result,
the point keeps Bournemouth in the relegation zone, while Leicester also remain
deep in trouble in 17th in the table.

90+4: CHANCE! Mahrez breezes past two players near the right-hand byline, but his ball into the middle is just about smuggled behind for a corner by the home defence.
Nothing comes from the resulting set play though as Bournemouth clear their lines.

90+2: Good wing play down the left by Fraser earns his side a corner, but his subsequent delivery is disappointing and easily punched clear at his near post by Schmeichel.

90: The fourth official says we will have another four minutes to play at the end of the second half.

88: SHOT! Surman gives the ball away in a bad position, but Vardy fails to take advantage after flashing his shot well wide of the goal.

88: SUB! A third and final change by the hosts as Fraser comes on for Stanislas.

87: Fuchs' long throw in causes a bit of panic in the home defence, until Begovic comes to punch the ball away.

85: SAVE! Five minutes left to play and both teams are now really going for it as Surman tests Schmeichel with an effort that is straight at the Dane.

83: SHOT! The visitors win a rare corner, swung in from the left, and after Begovic punches the ball clear, Mahrez's low shot is pushed away by the Bournemouth 'keeper.

82: SUB! Afobe comes on for Defoe for the closing stages.

Will the deadlock be broken? First goalscorer favourite Defoe is now out to 16/1 to net first while Iheanacho is 22/1 to open the scoring.

80: It looks like Defoe might be coming off shortly as Howe looks to play his last card.

78: SAVE! This is now end to end as Gray tests Begovic with a curler from just outside the area that forces the Bournemouth 'keeper to beat clear.

76: SAVE! Stanislas goes on a mazy run down the left, before testing Schmeichel at his near post with a well-struck shot that the Dane beats clear to safety.

75: SUB! Leicester make their third and final change of the game as Mahrez comes on for Albrighton.

73: SO CLOSE! Defoe lays the ball off for the unmarked Surman on the edge of the area, but his curler just shaves the right-hand post.

72: Already the introduction of the pact Ibe down the right has given the hosts a bit of re-energisation. 

70: CLOSE! Ibe finds Cook on the edge of the area, but his low shot is flicked over the bar from close range by Defoe.

69: SUBS! Both sides make changes, with Ibe coming on for Ibe, while Iheanacho replaces Okazaki in attack for the visitors. 

68: Midway through the second half and this game is on a knife edge as Pugh fires wastefully over the bar from 25 yards out.

66: SHOT! Better from Leicester as Okazaki and Gray play a one-two on the edge of the area, but the latter's shot flies high over the bar.

65: There is just a little bit of nervousness starting to creep around the ground given how dominant the hosts have been.

63: SHOT! Pugh thunders a 30-yard effort just wide of the left-hand post, although Schmeichel seemed to have that covered.

62: Just some hints in the last few minutes that Leicester are starting to ask some questions of their opponents, finally, maybe as the hosts tire.

60: WHAT A MISS! Would you believe it, Albrighton's long ball into the box is aimed for Vardy, but the clearance breaks straight to Okazaki, who somehow side-foots wide of the open goal from six yards out.

59: Vital stretch by Morgan to get his boot on a dangerous-looking ball in from the left wing by Daniels.

57: Now Defoe wants a penalty for shirt pulling in the box by Maguire after Schmeichel has to stretch to clear Pugh's ball in from the left-hand byline.

55: SHOT! Stanislas now tries his luck with a low drive from 30 yards out that Schmeichel does well to gather at the first attempt.

54: Pugh's ball into the box appears to strike a Leicester hand in the box, but again Mr Scott waves away Bournemouth's protests.

52: The second half has begun much like the first period, with the hosts attacking..

PIC! The visitors will need more from Okazaki (left) in this second half in support of lone frontman Vardy.

49: Great recovery tackle by new man Iborra to get back and concede an early corner for Bournemouth.
But Schmeichel does well to punch the resulting corner clear.

46: SUB! OK we are back underway at the Vitality, and unsurprisingly the Foxes have made one change at the break, with Iborra coming on for King.

The Soccer Saturday Price Boost is currently 7/1 at half-time, with Manchester United two goals to the good but Leicester and West Ham level.
Back the Soccer Saturday Price Boost here.

HT: Referee Scott blows his whistle to bring an end to this utterly one-sided first half on the South Coast, where the scoreline remains goalless, but only because the hosts were denied a blatant early penalty.
Surely we will get some goals after the break... ?!

45+1: Late corner for the hosts, curled in from the right, and just about dealt with at the second attempt by the Foxes defence.

45: The fourth official says we will have just one extra minute to play at the end of the first half.

42: MISS! Cook flicks the ball over the top for King to get on to and after his cut back is cleared, the ball falls straight at Pugh's feet, but the midfielder fires over the bar from just inside the area.

41: Begovic has been a virtual spectator in this first half such has been the lack of attacks from the Foxes.

39: A chance for King to find the unmarked Surman on the edge of the box, but the striker does not lift his head up and instead loses possession in the box.

37: The game is now a little more even, although that is not saying much given the one-way nature of the opening 20 minutes.

35: Half-hearted appeals for a Leicester penalty as Vardy's header hits a hand in the box, but the referee deems it accidental. 


33: Shakespeare will be a very worried man at the minute given how short of ideas his side have been in the first half.

31: Morgan does well though to get his head on that whipped ball into the six-yard box, before Maguire completed the clearance.

30: King is virtually unplayable at the moment as now Ndidi brings the powerful forward down, handing the hosts another free kick in a promising position.

27: Pugh has been everywhere so far in the first half as the midfielder now gets free to the left-hand byline, but his centre evades all his team-mates in the middle.

25: Midway through the first half and to say Bournemouth are unfortunate not to be ahead would be an understatement.

23: CHANCE! Pugh runs free down the left, but from his inch-perfect pull back, King side-foots wide of the gaping goal.


In the end, a comfortable afternoon for the Premier League champions, who are up and running at home and head into the international break on six points and in the top four. 
For Everton, it's a first defeat of the season, courtesy of first-half strikes from Cesc Fabregas and Alvaro Morata.

90+2: Throw-in to Chelsea down the right as Azpilicueta works it over to the other side to Willian but Everton eventually clear.

90+1: Kante is stopped by a brilliant challenge from Besic, who has done a very effective job this second half in difficult circumstances. 

90: We're into three additional minutes at the end of this second half.

89: SHOT! Batshuayi wins the aerial ball and finds Willian, whose shot through the legs of Williams is saved at the second attempt by Pickford. 

87: Andreas Christensen comes on for Moses as the free-kick is gathered by Courtois.

87: YELLOW! Azpilicueata goes into the book for a foul on Lennon on the left side. Free-kick to Everton in a dangerous position.

86: SAVE! Lennon sets up Gueye who fires towards the top corner, but Courtois is equal to it, tipping the ball over for a corner. The positive changes from Koeman are forcing the issue now.

85: Willian and Batshuayi fail to make the most of a break down the other end as Rooney clears from Fabregas' ensuing corner. Alvaro Morata has an ice pack on his head. I don't think he's got a lump on his head. Just a measure of how hot it is!

84: CHANCE! Good period of possession from Everton, as the ball is worked out to the left to Sigurdsson, and the midfielder's cross is onto the head of Williams, but he can't find the far corner. That's a great position and he should be working Courtois.

83: Everton are making their third and final change as Jagielka leaves the field and on in his place comes Aaron Lennon. He was a second-half sub in Split, so a tactical change from Koeman.

81: CLOSE! Rooney's free-kick is cleared, but only as far as Besic who heads the ball back into the box, and Williams hooks it over his head towards goal, but his effort sails just onto the roof of the net.

80: BLOCK! Jagielka is careless in possession as Willian runs free down the right. He finds Bakayoko on the cut-back, but his shot is blocked by Besic. A let-off for the Everton skipper.

79: Everton win the free-kick after a powerful run forward from Rudiger. Positive play from the centre-half.

78: Second substitution for Chelsea and Stamford Bridge rise to applaud Alvaro Morata. He is replaced by Michy Batshuayi.

76: Moses catches Leighton Baines, it's completely not needed and he is the latest player to be yellow carded.

75: Tiemoue Bakayoko is going to be handed 15 minutes here as he replaces Pedro. The diminutive Spaniard has been outstanding again, especially in that opening half.

74: Williams has enjoyed more success in his duel with Morata this half, but no soon have Everton regained the ball that they concede possession with an aimless lump forward.

72: Everton look so much more complete with Calvert-Lewin running the channels this second half. He looks up but there's no one in a grey shirt running into the box. Koeman's side might as well go for it, and they are starting to assert themselves belatedly.

71: Rooney's afternoon has just got even worse as he's been giving Jon Moss too much verbal for the referee's liking. He's into the book.

70: Everton break away as Calvert-Lewin wins possession for his team, and the ball finds its way to Rooney outside the box. He tries his luck from distance, but he gets his shot horribly wrong, and the ball trickles out for a goal-kick.

68: Holgate does well to usher Alonso out for a corner, after Pedro breaks again menacingly from midfield. Rudiger has gone forward but the ball is played towards Azpilicueta whose shot is blocked.

67: Pedro is clattered by Besic. Antonio Conte will be putting his plans together over the international break for the Champions League return. He's yet to make a substitution today.

PIC: Antonio Conte is suited and booted again on the touchline and has been energetically barking out instructions all game.

66: Pickford looks to immediately release Calvert-Lewin, who again shows himself to receive the ball. He's already putting himself about, giving his side an outlet they desperately need.

65: Bizarre pause in play as Marcos Alonso has managed to break the corner-flag with his cross. 

64: Chelsea won't want to give Everton any encouragement, as Calvert-Lewin is straight into action with a challenge on Courtois to concede a free-kick.

62: Sandro looks over, and it is him who comes off to be replaced by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The youngster has certainly made a name for himself so far this term with an excellent performance at Manchester City last Monday. What can he do here.


60: SHOT! Williams does all the hard work in snuffing out Morata, but he doesn't clear his lines and Moses is onto the loose ball. He shoots low with his right foot, but Pickford gets down to save.

58: WIDE! Now it really should be three as Sandro loses the ball and Pedro runs forward and rather than shoot across goal, he tries to find the near post, but his effort is wide of the target.

57: Everton avoid conceding a third as Azpilicueta's low ball is left by Williams, and the ball goes through a body of players and out for a throw-in.

56: Willian has been everywhere for Chelsea and a lot of his classy touches are being pulled off. He is there to put pressure on Besic deep in his own penalty area to win back possession after the Bosnian is forced into a hurried clearance.

55: Morata links nicely with Willian, but Michael Keane is there to cut out the danger. Chelsea just warming into the half now. Gueye gives the ball away far too cheaply to turn over possession.

53: Chelsea are yet to really get going in this second half with Morata subdued so far. Baines is sloppy as he looks to get clear of Moses, but the Nigerian winger snaps in to win it. He plays a one-two with Willian, but Besic is across to snuff out the danger. Let off for Baines.

50: CHANCE! Everton pick up on a rare lapse from Chelsea as Rooney charges forward with the ball and releases Sandro, but the Spaniard's shot is dragged and deflected wide. First real chance for the visitors. 

49: Remember, Besic is playing amid reports his father was shot on Saturday in Bosnia. Let's see how he fares with his side already trailing 2-0.

48: The set piece comes to nothing, but Chelsea come forward again as Pedro looks to bend his left-foot shot around Williams, but he doesn't catch it clean.

47: Everton weren't an attacking force in the first half and Rooney will now look to get closer to Sandro. But Chelsea start the second half as they ended the first as Pedro wins a corner off Keane.

46: Chelsea get us back underway for this second half. Everton make a change as Muhamed Besic replaces Tom Davies.

Click here for all the latest in-play betting.


Chelsea are comfortable at the break thanks to strikes from Cesc Fabregas and Alvaro Morata. Plenty to ponder for Ronald Koeman, who may feel the best form of limiting the damage now is to attack.

45: Rooney is fired up as he goes right through the back of David Luiz in an aerial challenge. He's not happy with the service he's receiving.

45: There will be two additional minutes at Stamford Bridge.

44: Everton's three-man defence was designed to nullify this Chelsea forward line but the game is going the same way as last season, with the ball continually coming straight back towards the visitors' goal. It ended 5-0 to the hosts last November.

42: Chelsea on the front foot again as Fabregas finds Pedro running off Keane's shoulder, and it is Fabregas who then tries his luck from range but Pickford gets down to gather.

Morata has his second of the day. It's a quality ball in from Cesar Azpilicueta, and Pickford is in no man's land as Morata rises to head home. Michael Keane just got sucked under the ball. Chelsea well worth their 2-0 lead.

39: Keane clears Fabregas' measured ball towards Morata. That was very nearly the perfect pass, you can see Morata and Fabregas are on a very good wavelength.


It's all over. A big win for Southampton at home. A superb goal from Boufal to decide it. Stay tuned for highlights.

90+4: OFF THE POST! Boufal again impressing, breaking away from one tackle and then playing a super pass through for Austin, who hits the outside of the post after taking it past Foster.

90+2: Southampton look to be seeing this out comfortably enough. If they do win you'd have to say they deserve it for showing much ambition than the visitors.

90: Four minutes to be added on.

88: West Brom are going to finish this game with 10 men as they have used all their subs and Dawson has just gone off with injury. Not a good day for the Baggies' defence with Evans also injured earlier.

What a goal! A definite goal of the season contender and just what was needed to decide this game.
Superb goal.

83: Saints are finishing this game on top. They have got West Brom pushed back inside their own half, it's just a question of whether they can find a way through. There is very little space around the box.

81: Double change for Saints. Boufal and Austin are on for Long and Tadic.

81: SHOT! Redmond looks to bend a shot towards the far corner, it looks close but it actually flies a few yards wide.

80: This game is there to be won if either side can find a finishing touch. There have been chances, they just haven't been taken.

77: Final change for West Brom as Chadli is replaced by Phillips.


75: Southampton are upping the pressure again but all the crosses into the box are being dealt with so far.

73: SAVE! Chadli has a go from outside the box and forces Forster to tip over the bar.

71: CHANCE! Big opening for Southampton as a ball breaks for Tadic in the box. He only has Foster to beat but the goalkepeer comes out really quickly to smother shot.
There are appeals for a penalty as Tadic then goes down under pressure from Foster as they compete for the loose ball, but nothing is given.

69: Attacking change from Southampton as Redmond comes on for Romeu.

68: SHOT! Decent build-up play from Southampton as they work it inside from the left. Davis plays it on for Gabbiadini, who places a shot, but places it straight at Foster.

66: That's an easy decision for the referee as Chadli clips Tadic as he was about to break. Yellow card.

64: Wonder how long it will be before Southampton make a switch. They have Redmond on the bench along with Boufal and Austin.

62: CHANCE! West Brom have shown more since their change of formation and they are almost gifted a goal as Forster, who dropped a corner a few minutes ago, fails to claim a high ball and it bounces down in the box. A defender just about whacks it clear but that was poor from Forster under not much pressure.

60: CHANCE! What a chance for West Brom, their only real chance of the match, and it falls to former Southampton forward Rodriguez.
It's simple stuff as Rondon flicks on a long ball over the top for Rodriguez. He looks offside at first glance but he is actually played on. Terrible finish though, as he drags his shot well wide with just Forster to beat.

57: Mauricio Pellegrino is not happy. He's shouting and waving his arms in frustration as his side continue to struggle to break down West Brom.

55: Rodriguez has hardly been involved at all on his return to St Mary's and now the ball does fall to him around 20 yards out and he hits a really poor shot well wide.

53: Change for West Brom, and it's not an attacking one. McAuley is on for Barry. West Brom are going to a back three.

52: SHOT! Long turns and shoots from the left corner of the box. Straight at Foster. Southampton are dominating this game.

50: CLOSE! Cedric curls in a cross from the right and Gabbiadini does well to leap above Dawson, but he can't keep his header down.
Evans, by the way, is sitting with his team-mates on the bench after going off with an injury in the first half.

50: This must be quite tough watching for the West Brom fans who have travelled down. Their team are showing no ambition at all.

47: Nyom loses the ball in the left corner, Tadic gets away and plays into the box, but it's cleared. No change in the pattern of the game - Southampton are on top and West Brom are defending deep.

No changes at the break. Will there be a change of tempo from West Brom? We will see. Saints get us restarted.

Southampton in the ascendancy but unable as yet to score - they're evens as the second half approaches. Price Boosts include Gabbiadini to score a header at 11/1 and Bertrand to score a free-kick at 22s.

Saints have had two thirds of the possession and restricted West Brom to zero shots on target, but their finishing again has let them down. They have failed to score in four of their eight previous Premier League matches this season.

And that's half-time. Southampton's scoring struggles continue, even though they have had the better chances and controlled the game. More of the same needed from Saints but with a finishing touch.

45+1: There's so little support for West Brom when they get the ball in the Southampton half. Rarely is there a forward pass on so they have to keep going sideways and back.

45: Two minutes to be added on.

43: SHOT! Southampton still knocking on the door as Davis bends in a corner and Yoshida heads goalwards from 12 yards out, but Foster does well to palm it behind.
CLOSE! From the next corner, Yoshida has another effort, this time an overhead kick. It's a decent attempt, even though it goes wide.

41: Chance for West Brom on the break as Rondon plays it out to Nyom on the left. He checks inside and hits a shot which flies way over the bar. Ambitious effort.

40: It's really not happening for West Brom going forward, not helped by a passing accuracy of 70%. Rondon has had just one touch in the box.

37: Another penalty appeal, this time against West Brom as Long's pass hits Hegazi. Looked like it struck him on the side though and the referee says no penalty.

33: To add to the wind, it's now raining quite hard. Definitely an evening to be well wrapped up. Saints are still doing nearly all of the running.

31: West Brom are going to be forced into a change. Evans, who fell heavily after a challenge with Long earlier, is replaced by Nyom. Evans walking gingerly as he goes off and that might be a potential concern for Northern Ireland ahead of their World Cup play-off in a few weeks.

30: Appeals for a penalty from West Brom as a free-kick into the box appears to hit an arm, nothing given though.

29: CHANCE! Long's scoring drought goes on.
He's set up really well by Gabbiadini, who races away down the left side from halfway and then plays a good ball into the box for Long, but he can't finish from around eight yards out.

27: Chadli scored a good free-kick against Leicester on Monday, but he can't repeat from a similar position as he fires into the wall.


25: SHOT! It shows how deep West Brom are sitting that Van Dijk is allowed to carry the ball unchallenged until he gets about 30 yards out. With no pressure in front he decides to have a go and strikes his shot very well, but it flies just over the top corner. That would have been some goal.

23: CHANCE! Another opening for Southampton and it really be 1-0.
A wind-affected corner drops down in the six-yard box, Romeu takes a swing with his back to goal but drags his shot wide. Saints are creating all the chances so far.

21: SHOT! Well-worked by Southampton. Bertrand runs behind the defence and is played in down the left. He cuts it back into the box for Tadic, who hits a shot straight at Foster from an angle.

20: West Brom are not showing too much attacking ambition. They are defending deep and trying to hit Southampton on the break. Not much threat so far from the visitors though.

17: OFF THE POST! So nearly the opener. Bertrand whips the free-kick towards the corner, it flicks off Evans' head and hits the outside of the post.
Brilliant effort from Bertrand, and it might well have gone in if it didn't take the deflection.


FT: That's time! Tottenham are frustrated at home in the Premier League again! That's seven points dropped at Wembley already, but what a superb defensive display from Swansea.
Spurs upped the tempo in the second half and had a few penalty shouts, but it's honours even. Federico Fernandez man of the match for Swansea.

90+4: Eriksen, who else, is over it.  Bony clears it superbly and Swansea push out!

90+4: Routledge gives away a silly free-kick in a crossing position.  Final chance here?!

90+3: CHANCE! Llorente nods down a long ball from Eriksen, it falls kindly to Aurier, but he pokes it wide! Maybe should have done better.

90+2: It's cleared, but.
CLOSE! What a strike by Trippier! He hits it on the half volley, Fabianski would have had no chance, but it's half a yard wide!

90+1: Corner to Spurs. Four minutes added.

89: APPEAL! Another Spurs shout. Ayew maybe clips the heels of Aurier, who also seems to trip himself (a bit of both) but referee Mike Dean gives a booking for an Aurier handball. 

Another late goal at Wembley? It's a 9/4 Price Boost (from 2/1) that there's one in the closing stages.

87: Change for Swansea. Former Spurs man Routledge is on, van der Hoorn off. Taking a defender off for a midfielder? Strange.

85: Another Eriksen corner. It comes back to Vertonghen on the left of the box, but he slices it wide.
Tick, tock, tick, tock for Spurs.

83: Dier tries to dink the ball into the area for the on-running Aurier, but it's just out of play. 

81: CLOSE! Turn and twist by Kane on the edge, he's seen the near post open, but he flashes it half a yard wide! 

78: Swansea free-kick into the six-yard box.  Lloris punches clear, ti falls to Clucas, but he volleys well high and wide. Half a chance for the new signing.

76: Pen appeal.  Aurier crosses, it hits Olsson's knee and then arm, but that would have been extremely harsh. 

74: Spurs change. Son is replaced by Llorente for his Spurs Premier League debut.

72: Eriksen regularly looking for that killer ball in, but nothing is going for Spurs. Wilfried Bony replaces Abraham for Swansea. 

70: CHANCE! Eriksen with a trademark ball into the box for Alli, the midfielder tries to head it back across goal, but he miscues it completely and it goes behind him!

68: Spurs peppering the Swansea goal now. Son nods the ball back with his head, Alli tries an overhead kick, and Fabianski has to tip it over. 

66: CLOSE! What an unusual move. Son picks the ball up pretty much on the byline from an Eriksen corner.  he takes a couple touches in a tight space, but Fabianski gets down to save!
SAVE! From the resulting corner, Kane gets across the front and glances on Eriksen's corner, and Fabianski reacts brilliantly to tip over!

64: First booking of the game. Van der Hoorn is penalised for dragging his studs down Dier's heel. 
Also, Leroy Fer replaces Renato Sanches for the final half hour, while Sissoko is replaced by Aurier. 

63: As the ball was lofted long up to Abraham, Sanchez does tug back the striker slightly.  both let the ball run through, but if Mike Dean had seen that slightly differently, the Spurs man could have been in trouble. 

61: Tottenham do look more of a threat in the second half, that's for sure. 72 per cent possession now. 15 attempts to three.

59: CHANCE! Son is played through at an angle again, forces Fabianski into a decent save..
OFF THE BAR! Then, as Sissoko centres to Kane in a bit of space, the England man crashes it against the top of the bar from eight yards! So close for Spurs!


57: APPEAL! Big handball shout for Spurs! Trippier's ball runs through to Olsson, and it clearly hits him on the left arm. He doesn't have much of a clue about it, but it did travel about five yards, so he did have time to move his hand away.
I've seen them given.

55: Spurs just turning it up a tad, as are the home fans. But I do see a slight danger for Poch's side when they lose the ball. Abraham has held the ball of well and has Ayew running off him constantly. 

53: Just the 70 per cent possession for Spurs.  402 passes to 168 so far. But the vital statistic: no goals. 

51: Son slips it through Van der Hoorn's legs, goes down inside the box, but referee Mike Dean sees straight through him.

49: Eriksen is invited to shoot from the edge of the box, but he doesn't quite catch it. It skids along but Fabianski collects down to his right. 

47: A few options for Spurs on the bench but they've kept it as it is. Ball into the box from Alli, but it's a yard or so over Son's head.

46: Back underway. Interestingly, Swansea took an age to get out, while Spurs were out warming up for a few minutes. 

Swansea are 12/1 to win this game having got to the break all-square. It's Spurs still heavy favourites at 4/11 with the draw an 11/4 shot.
There are plenty of live RequestABets available - Kane to score, 12 or more corners and Kyle Naughton to be carded looks to have potential at 12/1.

HT: That's the half. No breakthrough for Spurs; frustration and a story of possession without punch.
Poch will want an improvement, Swansea defending very resiliently. 
Half-time highlights on their way.

45: Dier picks the ball up on the right, has Son in acres to his left, but decides to go down a cul-de-sac instead!
Vertonghen then picks it up 25 yards out has a pop, and Fabianski dives to his left to save. Frustrating for Spurs. 

43: Free-kick to Swansea from deep. Fernandez gets up, and the last touch was off Vertonghen. Corner. 
CHANCE! Van der Hoorn gets up well from the corner, but it's a yard high and wide. Could have done better there.


41: Poch will be asking for more tempo from his Spurs side. They've had all of the ball, but he'll feel they haven't moved it quick enough in the final third to pull Swansea's defence apart. 

39: Eriksen takes the corner, Abraham gets it away, and Trippier's shot back into the box hits the ground and goes wide. 

38: The Spurs fans raise the decibels a tad as they look to open Swansea up before the half-time break. Trippier slips in Son, who puts a fierce low ball into the box, and Fernandez slices it just over the bar! Kane was waiting to tap in.

36: Spurs trying to pick the lock here. Lots of short passing in tight areas around the box, but Swansea are incredibly well organsied..  so far.

33: Federico Fernandez is having a fine game. He gets up highest to Eriksen's dangerous cross, and clears it well outside the box. 

31: The corner is cleared, and at the other end Swansea stick a few balls in the box. Vertonghen and Alderweireld clear, and Tottenham eventually push out.

29: Swansea struggling to get out of their half. Other than that one Swansea break it's been all Spurs in the first half. Eriksen's ball is very good, but Fernandez clears well ahead of Son. Corner.

27: Kane finds Trippier on the right, but his cross is far too close to Fabianski. Swansea can settle. 


25: Rare Swansea break, and it comes from some nice play from Sanches. He finds Carroll, who releases Abraham. Sanchez comes across, but can't make a tackle, but Abraham's pull back to the edge to Carroll is closed down well by Dier. 

23: Vertonghen brought down on the edge of the box. Dier steps up and goes for the goalkeeper's side, top right, but it's high and wide. 

21: It's all Spurs in possession. Son and Eriksen seeing lots of the ball so far, but Swansea are harrying well. The away fans making plenty of noise at Wembley.  they remember this place fondly after their 2011 play-off win and 2013 League Cup triumph.

Harry Kane's effort from a 30-yard free-kick was saved by Fabianski earlier on.

18: Another nice Spurs move. Lovely interplay on the edge of the box, I counted three one-twos in that little move.  it ends up with Son, but he blazes it over the bar.
Good approach play from the hosts. They're knocking on that door.


It's all over at the Amex and the second half was considerably better than the first, with plenty of late drama. 
Anthony Knockaert thought he had won it for Brighton but a silly, silly foul from Bruno on Dominic Calvert-Lewin at the death saw Wayne Rooney convert from the spot. 
So it's points shared and match highlights are on the way in 15 minutes!

90+4: SAVES!!! Superb saves from Ryan there at the near post, firstly from Mirallas and then from Calvert-Lewin on the follow up. It was a packed box and how he saw both of those, is beyond me. 

90+3: Yellow card for Mirallas now as he fouls Dunk in the middle of the park. Last roll of the dice for Brighton?

90+2: Rooney is substituted just after the goal and Davies is on in his place. There are also four added minutes at the end of the second half.

No mistaking from Rooney, who slots home past Ryan.
Is there a winner in this?

89: PENALTY EVERTON! Sigurdsson takes the free-kick and as he does, Bruno elbows Calvert-Lewin in the face inside the area. It's a stupid thing to do and Michael Oliver instantly blows his whistle. There are some stern words between the two captains as Bruno gets a yellow card.
Rooney to take.

88: Knockaert takes one for the team there as he stops Mirallas in his tracks. Free kick Everton.  

87: SAVE!! Another superb save from Pickford as Brighton toy with Everton now. It's a lovely give and go between Brown and Izquierdo, and the latter hits a great strike - but the goalkeeper is equal to it and pushes away.

85: A few changes in the aftermath of the goal with Baines coming off for Mirallas and Murray being replaced by Brown. 

There's the goal!! You can't say it hasn't been coming from Brighton, and it's a finely worked goal from the hosts. 
Bruno skips over Calvert-Lewin on the right flank, setting up Izquierdo in the box but his shot is saved by the feet of Pickford. 
However, the rebound is poked into the path of Knockaert by Gross and he fires home under the body of the Everton goalkeeper to scenes of wild celebration. 

81: NO PENALTY! A third penalty appeal for Everton not given in this game as Baines and Gross go up for a challenge in the box, and the latter going to ground. 
Maybe not the best position for Baines but not sure it was a penalty.

81: WIDE! Niasse only has eyes for the goal there as a Calvert-Lewin header is played into his path, but his shot goes high and wide. Rooney and Sigurdsson were there for support, but he went for the glory. 

80: Appeals from Sigurdsson for a penalty there and he has a good case as Gross pulls his shirt in the area. Nothing is given by Michael Oliver though, frustratingly for the Everton man. 

77: CHANCE! Again for Brighton as Knockaert goes close. His inital cross into the box is headed away by an Everton shirt, but it lands back at the feet of the Frenchman.
He thinks he's in but his second effort is also blocked by Everton, trickling across the face of goal before going wide. 

76: SAVE!! A fantastic save from Pickford as Izquierdo collects the ball on the left of the park before striding across the top of the box and taking aim - but his fizzing effort is saved well by the goalkeeper.
Meanwhile, Rooney is furious after a foul on him went unpunished, and remonstrates with the referee after the save. 

74: CHANCE! Big chance for Everton as Rooney picks out Calvert-Lewin at the back post with a superb cross. The youngster controls with his chest before attempting to slot home, but Ryan reads well and gets down low to make the save. 

73: Changes for Brighton now as March is replaced by Izquierdo and Duffy is indeed going off after what looks like a groin injury, and replaced by Hunemeier.

72: Uh oh, this isn't good for Brighton fans. Duffy has gone down after a tussle with Niasse and he's instantly waving at the bench. 
The medical team are on and it's a nervous wait now for the home side.  

70: Free kick number 500 now, this time for Brighton as Murray is fouled to ironic cheers from the home fans. 
Gross delivers, but the offside flag is already raised as Pickford comes out to punch the ball award ahead of Duffy, who is the man penalised by the linesman. 

69: Sigurdsson takes and he goes for goal himself, but it goes well wide of the post. He shakes his head after and he knows it wasn't his best.
Meanwhile, a change for Everton as Gueye is replaced by Niasse. 

68: ANOTHER Everton free kick as the ball is pinged round the box after Sigurdsson's delivery. This one is much closer after Holgate is fouled by Murray with Sigurdsson, Rooney and Baines all over it.

67: Free kick to Everton as Rooney is dragged back by Dunk as he looks to get onto the end of a long pass. 
A silly booking for the Brighton defender, with Rooney nowhere near the ball.

65: Another Brighton corner is delivered, this time it meets Duffy at the back post, but Jagielka is marking him well as the ball runs wide.

64: Gross takes and it's not a bad delivery at all, with the initial delivery cleared by Everton and landing to March just outside the box. 
He plays a superb pass down the left-hand side of the box for Knockaert but his attempted cross back into the box is cleared behind by Holgate. 
Knockaert jeers up the crowd before the corner is taken, but a foul on Gueye not long after the delivery sees Everton with the free kick.

63: Free kick to Brighton as Keane is penalised for pulling back Gross. It's just near the left touchline and in a good position for Brighton.  


60: SAVE! A decent collection from Pickford this time, who hasn't had too much to do in the game so far as March once again shows himself to be a menace down the left flank.
His cross goes into the box, but the Everton stopper is out to collect the ball. 

58: Gueye is back on to boos from the home fans. Not a very forgiven bunch today!
SLIP! Wow, Vlasic will not want to watch that one back. Everton work the ball really well around the top of the box with Gueye picking out the Croatian as he tries to make his way into the box. 
However, as he goes to shoot, he slips on the surface and the ball fires well wide of any target. He then gets up and starts remonstrating with the ground - as if it was the pitch's fault. Not too sure about that one really. 

56: Boos around the Amex as Gueye goes to ground following a foul from Propper, who does catch the midfielder with his studs up and gets a yellow for his troubles. 
A break in play now for medical treatment. 

54: Another good save from Ryan, although less spectacular this time as Holgate's cross is headed towards goal by Calvert-Lewin but it is straight at the goalkeeper who holds well. 

53: Free kick to Everton as Gueye is fouled by Stephens. An earlier one went unpunished, but the visitors win the advantage this time. 
It creates a good opening as well as Vlasic produces a great back heel to finds Holgate down the right flank, with the wing back bursting into the box and hammering an effort towards goal. 
Ryan reads it well though and makes a strong save, before the Brighton defence clear the remaining danger. 

51: Good defending from Keane there who has had a solid afternoon, with March getting away down the left once again and picking out the run of Murray who appeared to be through on goal. 
However, Keane manages to shrug the striker off the ball, and eventually clear. Brighton look good in the second half so far. 

48: Not a bad start from either side as March gets away down the left-hand side for Brighton but he is tracked well and cannot get his cross into the box. 
It's a similar story at the other end as Sigurdsson races down the right flank, but his cross is well cleared by Dunk.

46: Brighton get the game back underway at the Amex. 


There goes the whistle for the first half, and all in all, not the most scintillating football of the weekend but each side have had a chance to go ahead. 
Changes at half-time would not be unexpected as both sides need a spark here.

45: One minute added on at the end of the first half. 
Ironic applause rings out around the ground as Vlasic is penalised for a foul, with Brighton fans aiming it at Michael Oliver. 

44: A great run from Propper there as he runs into the space left by Everton, and attempts to find Murray down the side of the box but once again, the striker is flagged for offside. 

42: Everton's turn for a free kick now as Murray is penalised for a foul on Keane, although it didn't look like too much of one from the replays. 
The visitors don't make too much from the advantage, though.

40: Free kick to Brighton as Rooney nicks the ankles of Duffy on the far right. The felled man takes and boots it up the field, allowing March to get a decent cross into the box - which is headed away by Keane - before Stephens tries his luck from range but his effort flies over the crossbar. 

38: Brighton are dominating proceedings now, and they will be looking to nick a goal before the half-time whistle. 

36: NO PENALTY!! A second in as many minutes for Brighton that goes unanswered. 
They hit Everton on the break with Gross firing a ball into the box for the waiting Murray, who controls with his chest but before he can latch onto the ball on the floor, he goes to ground as Keane miss times his jump and pushes him to the floor. 
Was he lucky to get away with it? Perhaps, but Michael Oliver is now subject to chants from the home fans. 

33: CHANCE! The best chance of the game for Brighton as they take the corner, with March whipping a ball into the box from the left flank that Everton do clear - but only to Knockaert at the top of the box.
He shoots but once again sees his effort blocked but Dunk is chasing the rebound down the right-hand side of the box and also shoots at the near post - but is denied by the leaping body of Keane who pushes the effort behind. 
Dunk is appealing for a penalty as the ball appears to ricochet off the elbow of Keane, but it would have been very harsh to award. A great few minutes of pressure from the hosts!

31: Better from Brighton, poor from Gueye who's sloppy pass lands at the feet of March, who strides forward before playing a give and go with Propper that allows March to get away down the left flank.
He puts a great ball into the box, but Keane does well to put it behind for a corner. 

30: A superb ball from Clavert-Lewin there as he cuts into the middle of the park from the left flank, spotting the run of Vlasic.
He chips a ball over the top for his team-mate, but Vlasic cannot connect as it just has too much on it, allowing Ryan to collect with ease. 


28: Not a bad break from Brighton as they look to work an attack, but Murray is flagged for offside as Propper tries to find him with a diagonal ball. A shame for the hosts, who are yet to have a clear cut chance this half. 

26: Another Everton free kick, this time Dunk the man to be penalised for a foul on Schneiderlin over on the right flank, similarly to the one just a few minutes ago.
Sigurdsson takes but Propper does well to read it and puts the ball out of play at the first time of asking. 

25: A free kick for Everton now as Murray fouls Schneiderlin, just catching the Everton man in the back of the head with a knee. 
Sigurdsson delivers once again, and the ball bounces off a few heads before coming to Calvert-Lewin, but he doesn't quite know about it and can only direct his header over the crossbar. 


An energetic performance from the visitors topped off with two stunning goals was enough in the end. Southampton look like a team in a negative spiral and never really looked like troubling the visitors who were pretty dominant throughout. 
Fast times for the Hornets. Where do Southampton go from here? 

90: CHANCE! A poor punch from Gomes who redeems himself nicely by holding on to Cedric's fierce drive from 25 yards. That is Saint's first shot in anger of the whole game, and it's come in stoppage time. Southampton fans must be wondering what has happened to their team. 

87: The electronic board has broken down on the touchline at St Mary's so there is much merriment to be had each time the board goes up, which now is just some plastic cards with numbers printed on them.
That is the most interesting things that has happened in the last five minutes. 

85: Carrilo has impressed today for Watford. The Peruvian stops Bertrand in his tracks as the full-back makes one more doomed attempt to get forward. 

83: Deeney throws Stephens to the floor in a bid to get through on goal. A little over-enthusiastic from the skipper who Marco Silva said this week is more or less back to full fitness. He looked a little clumsy there though the substitute. 

81: Gray off for Watford. Not his best game today perhaps. On comes Deeney. 

78: Tadic hasn't been able to make an impact since coming on at half time. Not for the want of trying it must be said - there's been plenty of endeavor from the Serb which is more than can be said for a lot of this Saints side. Southampton look like a team that have failed to score in eight of the last nine though.
There's a slow trickle towards the exits now.

75: Ryan Bertrand is the only one in red who looks like he has any idea of how to make anything happen. He's making runs but no-one is finding him. It's all getting a bit frustrated out there from Southampton.
Actually it's been frustrated from about the 20th minute onward. This is not the response to the goal drought that the St Mary's faithful wanted or expected. 

72: It sums up Saints' day that from a fine free kick opportunity at one end they're under pressure within seconds at the other. Gray breaks with the ball and Saints are exposed but the ball into the box from Richarlison isn't quite up to scratch and the clearance is a simple one from Stephens. 
Typical of this insipid performance from Saints that they came closer to conceding a third than getting back into it from that position. 

71: Long is going nowhere in the corner and it's the walking liability Holebas who gives away a needless free kick. A very inviting dead ball for Saints.  

70: Southampton look like a team without a clue. Last throw of the dice for Pellegrino as Austin replaces the hapless Boufal. 

It was always going to take something special to eclipse that stroke from Doucoure in the first half but Janmaat has done it here. It's an absolute pearl of a goal.
The ball is hoisted into the air on the edge of the Saints box and Cleverley gets up to head it. It drops nicely for Janmaat, maybe 30 yards from goal, and the Dutchman absolutely hammers it into the bottom corner of Forster's goal. 
Was the goalkeeper slow in getting down? Maybe. That won't bother Watford. Two sensational strikes and they're firmly in control. 

63: Cedric's cross is put behind by Janmaat. Corner Southampton. 

60: CHANGE: Kaboul's done his hamstring and is off for Mariappa, whilst Kiko is also hooked for Janmaat to enter the game.

58; CHANCE! It's the centre-back Stephens who suddenly finds himself in space on the edge of the box but it was a centre-backs touch and the ball doesn't stick to him as the goal opens up. 
There's a second chance for Bertand arriving at the far post but the England full-back has stars in his eyes and wacks it into the side-netting despite a host of Saints players better placed. 

57: A rare moment of class from Saints ends in a predictable shambles. Redmond shows good feet to break out for midfield and feed Boufal but the Moroccan shows zero composure with his strike, launching the ball somewhere towards the back of that stand behind Gomes' goal.
It's summed up Boufal's day and really and truly his whole Southampton career to date, snatching mediocrity from the very jaws of promise.

54: A free header for Challobah as a corner is floated in for Watford. Inexplicable how he failed to make contact there, there was no one anywhere near him but he completely failed to get anything on it.  

51: Just a sniff of something from Saints as Bertrand gets in behind the Watford back four for the first time today. There's no end product from the England full-back but just a spark finally from the hosts. 

49: Holebas always looks a little like a yellow card waiting to happen and it's just happened. A fair shout - it was a lazy trip on Redmond as the winger looked to sprint away from him.

47: More of the same so far for Saints as Gabbiadini is asked to chase a hopeless long ball forward. He can't be happy about the service he's had today the Italian. It's small wonder the goals have been few and far between of late for Southampton. 
Very few ideas going forward from anyone in red and white.  

46: Chalobah fancies his chances of emulating Doucoure in the first minute of the second half. The England man catches it well but his 25-yard strike is straight at Forster who gathers easily.  

45: Tadic is on for Ward-Prowse for the second half. Something needs to change for Pellegrino. Plenty of pressure on Tadic's shoulders. 


You could almost make an argument for that wonder strike from Doucoure being the worst thing that could have happened for this game from an entertainment perspective. Southampton have tried to play on the counter but Watford are just too powerful for them in midfield and are playing a very effective pressing game to seriously limit Saints' time on the ball.
It seems eminently plausible that the Hornets will stick men behind the ball and look to shut the game down in the second 45 now that they have the advantage. No-one's holding their breath for a classic at St Mary's.


43: Saints try and thread straight through the middle of the visitors but Watford are just too solid for them. Expect more of this hard-nosed bullying from the visitors now they have something to cling on to. 
Up the other end Doucoure has a chance to lash in a spectacular second but his touch has deserted him since he put Watford ahead, and this time it sails over the bar. 

41: And it's very nearly two as Richarlison steps inside and lashes one at Forster's near post. The ball lands in the side netting as the goalkeeper dives to his right but it was a fine piece of invention from the Brazilian, inspired by perhaps by the quality of Doucoure's finish moments earlier. 

Out. Of. Nothing. A high ball up to the edge of the box isn't dealt with by Southampton and the ball breaks to Doucoure twenty yards out. The strike is totally out of keeping with everything we've seen here in terms of quality and it spins off the turf and beyond the dive of Fraser Forster in the Saints goal. 
A goal worthy of any match, and probably too goo for this one. 

36: If you wanted to put a positive spin on things here you would say that Watford are doing a very fine job of pressuring their hosts whenever they get the ball in midfield. Three men descend on Ward-Prowse before the Saints man has time to settle or think about getting his side moving.
It's not pretty, but it is mighty effective from the Hornets.

34: Boufal is heaved off it by Chalobah as he looks to break down the left flank. As has been the case for most of the afternoon so far, brute force trumps finesse. 

31: Romeu spots something up in front of him and thuds the ball forwards, and everyone stands and watches it sail straight out of play. Austin was up there for Saints but there was no way he was getting anyway near Romeu's artless hoof. That moment was a very neat summary for what's happened to the game as we creep towards half time. 

28: What is to be said about these last ten minutes? Not too much in truth. It's gone a little quiet around St Mary's, both teams have aloud the urgency to drop out of the game after a fairly industrious opening 20 minutes.
'Restless' would be the watchword for what we're seeing at the moment. 


25: Mario Lemina watching on from the bench for Saints. £15m plus hasn't yielded a goal on the south coast yet for the Gabon international. You'd think he'll get a chance at some point today to open his Southampton account, especially if we get into the last quarter and Saints are struggling to impose themselves, as they are currently. 

23: Hollebas steps up and bends it wide. Not a terrible effort by any means but Silva would have probably hoped his side would have made a little more of a very presentable situation there. 

21: And that's a reminder oh why the Moroccan has flattered to deceive since that big money move. He absolutely crashes into Cleverly on the edge of the box and this is a very inviting free-kick for the visitors. 
There's a few in yellow who are looking interested in this.

19: Boufal does well out on the byline and cuts an inviting ball back for someone to steam into. Unfortunately for Saints there was no one steaming onto it and it's cleared by the visitors.
That was just hint of why Southampton were pursued to part with a club-record fee to bring him in last term. 

17: Bertrand and Carrilo get in a tangle and the Peruvian cries foul play. He would have been in the Watford wide man but for losing his footing but there was no real intent to play the man from Bertrand, so thunks the referee anyway. 

15: Chalobah and Romeu clatter into each other and the shockwaves are felt around St Mary's. Two absolute units bouncing off each other there which was quite a sight. Somehow neither player looks remotely ruffled by the experience.  

13: Gabbiadini looks to get in behind the Hornet's back four but doesn't quite have the pace for it. They're playing mostly on the counter at the moment the hosts with Watford bossing the ball. 

11: Nice link up play between Chalobah and Gray on the edge of the Saints' box. The ball through is just too heavy from Chalobah and Gray didn't have the legs for it, but there is intent in the way Watford are moving the ball about in the final third. 
Shaping up nicely this.

9: Excellent footwork from Redmond who wriggles free in midfield to free Ward-Prowse. The midfield's ball into the box isn't ta`ken under control by Gabbiadini who can't get his feet set for a shot, but suddenly Saints came to life there. 

7: Boufal hacks at it wildly and puts his clearance straight up in the air. Watford are looking lively out wide so far. A couple of nice crosses have gone in and Pellegrino would have liked more composer from the Moroccan Boufal there. 


5: There was a time when two Brazilians in the Watford starting XI would have seemed gloriously unlikely. Those days are long gone though, with Richarlison and Gomes shaping up to be key players for the Hornets this year.
The former takes a wack and Watford have a chance from the deadball but the ball from Kaboul isn't up to spec. Good start from the visitors. 

4: Davis tries to release Gabbiadini down the left but there's too much on the ball and it's through to Gomes.

3: Chalobah is down on his back having a bit of treatment It doesn't look like anything to serious for the new England call-up. He's back up on his feet.

2: Saints looking wide early on here with both full-backs nice and high up the pitch in the first few minutes. Bertrand and Redmond down the left looking particularly eager to link up. 
They'd love an early goal Southampton in light of their recent scoring woes.  

1: And we're underway at St Mary's!

The teams are out at St Mary's. Two teams looking to cling onto their unbeaten starts under new managers. 
It's a sell-out on the South Coast, nice lively atmosphere. Almost ready to roll here. 

That’s concludes our coverage from the Vitality Stadium, where Bournemouth breathed life into their season with their first win of the campaign. Be sure to keep an eye on the Sky Sports platforms for more reaction to tonight’s game. Thanks for joining us, we hope you can join us on the next Friday Night Football.

Jermain Defoe and Jordon Ibe discuss Bournemouth's comeback win over Brighton.

Liam Rosenior says Brighton have to learn lessons after surrendering a lead in their defeat to Bournemouth.

That's all from Chris Hughton, who has taken the positives from a promising display, despite tasting defeat for the third time this season.

Asked to comment on Bournemouth's match-winner, Hughton added: "I have no doubt there are still many good years in Defoe."

"I was pleased with the way we went about our game until we conceded. Being the away team, we were good value for our lead. There were periods of the game where we were good. It's hard to take on the balance of play but this is what you're up against." 

The post-match thoughts of Chris Hughton.
"I thought we were going to win. I knew we would be under pressure in the final period, it's normal against a home team with good players who probe. We had to be resilient right until the end and we defended really well for large periods but unfortunately the two times we didn't was for their two goals. It was a tough lesson."

That's all from an jubilant Eddie Howe, we await Chris Hughton.

“He is one of the best finishers I’ve ever seen. He’s
lost none of that. We need to get to know as a team what Jermain wants as he is
different to the strikers we have at the club. It is all about creating more
openings for him.”

“It would’ve been easy to go under tonight. We did it the
hard way and that was the most impressive thing. Jordon’s cameo sparked that
revival but once we scored we came on strongly.”

“Jordon is a player of immense promise. You estimate how
young he is. But he’s still learning and improving. He’s come back a better
player this season and hopefully this is start of something for him.”

"Very relieved," Howe said. "It’s pure relief for everyone connected with
the club. It feels longer than the four games we’ve been without a win. We’ve
had to dig really deep tonight to get that win."

Eddie Howe up first.

It's super sub Jordon Ibe, who laid on both goals in a clinical second-half cameo.


Here's another chance to see what Carra's talking about.


There's the whistle and there are joyous scenes in the stands as Bournemouth have their first Premier League win of the season.
Brighton took the lead just after the break through Solly March but the introduction of Jordon Ibe in the 65th minute changed the game for the hosts as he picked up two assists to set up Andrew Surman and Jermain Defoe to score. 
A superb performance from the former Liverpool man, and the Cherries have their first points on the board. 

90+4: A late scramble in the Bournemouth box as Brighton are awarded a late, deep free kick which Ryan pumps into the box but the hosts hack away. Eventually. 


90+3: A little bit of cramp for Arter there allows Bournemouth to make a final change, with Dan Gosling coming on for King. 

90+2: With the evening he's had so far, you expect Ibe to go for goal and that he does, but his effort just skims wide of the post. It was inches away, though.

90: Four minutes added on at the Vitality Stadium. 
Bournemouth win a free kick just outside the penalty area as King is just fouled by Dunk outside the box. It's close but still a great chance for the hosts. 

89: Good play from Afobe there who does well to draw the corner from Rosenior, who pokes the ball behind. Bournemouth take is short as they look to run the clock down.

87: A corner for Brighton that is initially cleared by Bournemouth but the ball falls into the path of Rosenior at the top of the box and he lets fly - but the ball goes high over the crossbar. 

86: Boos from around the ground as Afobe and Duffy go up against each other once again, and Brighton come off the better as they win the free kick. It's the second time in as many minutes that Afobe feels he should win the decision, but Craig Pawson decides otherwise. 

85: Good goalkeeping from Begovic there as a hooked pass from Murray sends the ball into Izquierdo's path but the Bournemouth stopper reads it well and comes out to collect at the feet of the Brighton man.

83: A few cheers around the ground as the linesman slips over as he signals for a Bournemouth goal kick as Ake ushers out Izquierdo at the right corner flag. 

80: A free kick for Bournemouth in a dangerous area, just on the left with Ibe and Surman over it. The former delivers but Brighton do well to see it out of play. 
A corner then comes in for the hosts but again, the Seagulls manage to clear well. It may have settled a few nerves in the away camp after a topsy turvy few minutes. 


78: Another change for Bournemouth now as Defoe is replaced by Benik Afobe. 

77: Almost an instant reply from Bournemouth, but Knockaert's inviting cross is turned away by the home defence. 
Hughton responds to going behind with a double change as Glenn Murray and Jose Izquierdo come on for Knockaert and Gross, who looks to be carrying a knock from an earlier challenge. 

Ibe and Defoe combined to complete the turnaround.

A lovely goal from Bournemouth and Ibe is the provider once again! What an inspired change it has been from Howe. 
The corner in initially cleared by Brighton but Ibe is lurking at the top of the box and glides through the middle of Hemed and Knockaert who do not want to tackle him so close to the area but it doesn't work out well for them anyway. 
Ibe slides the ball through to the waiting Defoe on the right of the box and he makes no mistake in slotting home under Ryan as the Vitality Stadium goes wild. 

73: Gross eventually makes his way off the field as Bournemouth have the corner. Brighton temporarily down to ten men here.

72: Boos from the away fans as Gross remains down on the floor at the top of the Bournemouth box as the hosts continue playing.
CLOSE! It's then nearly a second goal for Bournemouth and Ibe is involved again, but his shot is deflected high over the bar from the leaping Brighton players. 


Yep, Ibe can change Bournemouth's fortunes! He picks up the assist and Surman gets his first ever Premier League goal. 
It's some superb play from the former Liverpool man, trying to find King at the top of the box but the striker slips, allowing Surman onto the ball who in turn picks out Ibe on the right of the box. 
He then produces a superb back heel pass around the legs of Propper that finds Surman again in the middle of the box and he slots home past Ryan. 
A second goal of the season for Bournemouth and the home side are on their way to their first points of the season!

Can Jordon Ibe change Bournemouth's fortunes?

65: Here comes the first change for Bournemouth as Fraser comes off for Jordon Ibe. 

64: A great passage of play from Bournemouth who have really done well in the wide areas, but it's just the finish in the box that is lacking. Daniels puts in a superb cross that just needs a head on it but it misses any Bournemouth bodies in the box and goes wide.

61: King is not happy with the referee as he tries to make some space on the right flank, but March and Dunk match him and he eventually goes to ground. He is searching for the free kick but nothing is given from Craig Pawson.

58: Bournemouth react well to going behind, and could almost snatch a leveller at the other end but Daniels' delivery is well collected by Ryan ahead of the incoming King. 

They should have scored just minutes ago and they finally make the breakthrough as March nets his first Premier League goal. 
It's a superb delivery from the right from Gross, with Smith bent over as he tries to mark March and allows the Brighton man to nod home past Bogovic. 
He wheels away with Knockaert to celebrate and Brighton lead at the Vitality Stadium.

CLOSE! The visitors were inches away from taking the lead!

53: OFF THE LINE! TWICE! Wow, how have Brighton not scored there with not one but two corners cleared off the line. 
The first comes from a Duffy header that is cleared off the line by Surman before Propper also tries to net the rebound but Begovic is across to save. 
Stephens then has an effort from the next corner, but it bounces on the underside of the bar and goes agonisingly wide. So close for the visitors. 

50: Not a bad opening from Brighton as Suttner slides in March down the left flank and while Smith tries to muscle him off the ball, the Brighton man gets ahead of him to race down the wing, before the Cherries man helps to see the ball wide for a Brighton corner. 

48: It's been more of the same at the start of the second half, with Knockaert nearly getting onto the end of a cross into the Bournemouth box but mostly, a passing game in the middle of the park with the hosts looking to build from the back.

46: Brighton get the game back underway at the Vitality Stadium. No half time changes just yet.




Everton: Pickford (6), Baines (5), Keane (5), Williams (4), Martina (5),
Schneiderlin (4), Gueye (5), Sigurdsson (5), Niasse (6), Vlasic (4),
Calvert-Lewin (6)
Subs: Rooney (5), Davies (6), Ramirez (n/a)
Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (7), Ward (8), Cork (7),
Hendrick (8), Defour (7), Arfield (7), Brady (7), Wood
(7)
Subs: Barnes (n/a)
Man of the match: James Tarkowski

All over at Goodison Park - what a win for Burnley! This increases the pressure on Ronald Koeman, his team lacked creativity again this afternoon.
They failed to break down a stubborn Burnley defence, with James Tarkowski superb. He was the man that replaced Michael Keane remember.
Burnley are up to sixth.

90+3: NO PENALTY! Another big Everton shout for a spot-kick as Williams' far-post header appears to come off Lowton. Referee Moss is not interested.
The replay shows that was good refereeing - it came off Lowton's chest.

90+1: All the noise is coming from the away end. This has been a superb performance from Sean Dyche's side. If they hold on they will have taken points from Stamford Bridge, Anfield, Wembley and Goodison Park. That's some achievement.

90: FOUR minutes of added time.

88: SUB! Jeff Hendrick may be the match-winner this afternoon but he won't complete the 90 minutes. Ashley Barnes is on in his place.
Referee Jon Moss comes over for a chat with Koeman, who is not happy with the handball decision a few moments' ago. The Everton boss clearly feels it was a spot-kick.

87: CHANCE! Better from Everton again as Sigurdsson turns the ball around the corner to Calvert-Lewin. The striker goes for the near post when he should be aiming for the far and Pope gets down to save.

86: SHOT! Sigurdsson wriggles free down the left and finds Davies, who curls an effort towards the far corner from 22 yards. Pope is at full stretch but Wood is there to head away.

84: NO PENALTY! Rooney wants a penalty after his header from Sigurdsson's cross flicks off the arm of Lowton. That would have been exceptionally harsh. Referee Moss gives a corner instead, which Burnley clear.

83: Another long-range effort - this time from Rooney - finds Row Z. Burnley have done brilliantly to restrict the home side to hopeful shots from distance.

82: SUB! A final change from Koeman as Sandro Ramirez replaces Niasse.

81: Gueye ambles forward - and with a lack of options in front of him - lashes a long-range shot over the bar. Whistles can be heard now.

79: Davies is furious with the assistant after he gives a goal kick following a scramble in the Burnley box. The Everton midfielder felt it came off Mee last but the replay shows it was the right call by the official.

77: Martina breaks forward but then checks back to pass to Keane, which is not well received by the home crowd. They want the ball forward early and often.
It's still far too laboured from Everton, with aimless long balls easily defended by Mee and Tarkowski.

75: Rooney puts in a swinging cross to the far post but Pope reads it well to punch clear. The Burnley stand-in 'keeper has been impressive so far.

72: Brady delivers a dangerous ball to the back post but Keane defends it very well, clearing with a big header. A second for Burnley looks just as likely as an equaliser for Everton.
The home side really need to step things up to get back into this.

72: Niasse wipes out Arfield and Burnley win a free-kick towards the corner flag. A promising position for Brady.

69: SUB! Tom Davies replaces the ineffective Nikola Vlasic.

69: Frustration is growing at Goodison. Baines comes forward and holds his hands out, as if to say 'Where's my options?' Everything is slow and side-to-side. Ronald Koeman is preparing another change.

67: CHANCE! Brady bursts into the area and has Wood at the far post for a tap-in but Pickford reads the cross superbly and intercepts. The opportunity came from lovely interplay involving Wood and Brady.

64: SUB! Rooney replaces Morgan Schneiderlin as Ronald Koeman takes off one of his two holding midfielders.

63: CHANCE! Calvert-Lewin tees up Baines to deliver and it's a good cross by the left-back. Niasse strains his neck and turns it goalward but his header is a yard wide.

62: Defour is fine to continue for Burnley, who concede a corner through Cork.
Sigurdsson delivers but again Wood is there for the visitors. The striker does a great job defending set-pieces in his own area.

60: Pickford smashes a kick forward and Pope is quick to read Niasse's run, coming off his line to head away. He catches his team-mate Defour in the process and the Burnley midfielder needs treatment. That looked painful.

Live Everton v Burnley Price Boosts.

59: YELLOW! Baines goes into the book for a lunge on Brady.

58: Niasse puts Mee under pressure and should have a corner but referee Moss gives a goal kick instead. It clearly came back off the Burnley defender.
Everton are putting in plenty of effort but they don't seem to have the required quality in the final third.

PIC: Penny for Ronald's thoughts.  After a tough start to the season, he must have expected more from a home game against Burnley.

55: Baines' left foot can usually be relied upon to produce quality but the Everton skipper smashes his cross out of play for a goal kick. More frustration for the home team.

53: It can't be long before we see changes from Everton if the score remains the same. Wayne Rooney is out and warming up.

52: Martina gets forward and wins a corner for the home side. Sigurdsson trots across to take but Wood rises highest to clear. It drops to Gueye but the midfielder blazes his long-range effort comfortably over Pope's bar.

50: YELLOW! Calvert-Lewin badly mis-times his tackle on Ward and that's an easy decision for referee Moss.

48: Better from Vlasic as he plays a one-two with Sigurdsson before his left-foot drive from 20 yards is well blocked by Tarkowski. Everton are on the front foot in the early stages.

Live Everton v Burnley Price Boosts.

46: No changes at the break - we are back under way for the second half at Goodison Park.


Everton have it all to do in the second half after Hendrick's first-half opener. Burnley have been superb and it's shaping up to be another frustrating afternoon at Goodison Park for the home side.

45: ONE minute of added time.

44: Burnley are finishing this half on top - it's been a very professional away performance from the visitors so far.

41: YELLOW! Arfield wants a penalty after Williams' tackle in the box but referee Jon Moss says it's a dive by the Clarets midfielder. It looks like a good decision by the official - Arfield went down very easily - but Everton are in defensive disarray. It was Williams' initial mistake that gifted the ball to Arfield in the first place.

40: YELLOW! Defour is booked for dissent. He wanted a free-kick for a clumsy-looking challenge on Tarkowski by Niasse but referee Jon Moss was happy with it.

38: SAVE! Wood redirects a long free-kick goalward with an improvised header but Pickford is well positioned to gather for Everton. That was a smart, instinctive effort from Burnley's summer signing.

37: Nine outfield players were involved in Burnley's 24-pass move for the goal. It really was a very impressive piece of play and a lovely finish by Hendrick.

34: This game is following a similar pattern to Everton's home game against Bournemouth last weekend. They went 1-0 down then and were saved by a double from substitute Niasse.
Still plenty of time for a repeat performance but the natives are understandably not too happy at the moment.

30: Niasse is full of running up front for Everton and he does well to drive into the Burnley half before checking back and finding Gueye on the edge of the area.
The midfielder slices his first-time shot, though, and it's well wide of Pope's goal.

28: And one quick break by Burnley forces Williams to concede a corner under pressure from Wood. Great running by the Clarets forward.
29: Tarkowski wins a header from the corner but Pickford comes out to punch and Everton eventually clear their lines.

27: The home crowd is already getting a little restless as their Everton side pass and probe. It's all very slow and at the moment Burnley are doing a decent job of closing down the space.

24: Everton will be ruing those early missed opportunities now. They have been the better team so far but were completely cut open by Burnley for the goal.

OK folks, that is all we have time for I am afraid from the Emirates, but not to worry as we will be back for more live football from both the Championship and the Champions League tomorrow night.

The Arsenal boss has also sung the praises of club-record signing Lacazette after his two goals helped beat West Brom on MNF.
"What is
interesting with Lacazette is that he is getting stronger in every game and
that is very positive," said Wenger after the game. "He adapts to the physical demands here and technically
he is intelligent and you could see on the goal he scored from the free kick
that on the rebound he was there. That is the quality of the striker’s to score
goals."

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger thinks referee Robert Madley was right to play on in the penalty incident involving Rodriguez in the first half.
"Mustafi
tackled and touched the West Brom player, it could have been given and the
referee left the advantage and I think rightly so as they were in a position to
score and in the end they hit the post," he told Sky Sports.
"So that is the
kind of decision that is difficult because if he does not give the advantage
and they miss the penalty, people will say why did he not give the advantage?"

West Brom boss Tony Pulis is fuming after his side were denied a first-half penalty at the Emirates.
"I think everybody has seen what’s happened today," he told Sky Sports. "I think if
you want to make an example of something, Sanchez actually dives on the edge of
the box for the first free-kick. And he should be booked for diving there, in
my opinion. Then you see the tackle in the box on Jay, the referee’s got a
great view, it’s a stonewall penalty.
"The great thing is everybody has seen it, so they make their
decisions. I don’t have to talk about it and I don’t want to talk about it. I
thought we played really well, we’ve missed a lot of chances in the first half,
the game got stretched in the second half and Arsenal can hurt you. We’re
disappointed.
"It’s not only a foul, the player could be sent off as well.
So it could be a penalty and playing against 10 men.
"Jake Livermore should score the rebound and we should score other
goals, we had opportunities. The disappointing thing tonight is Sanchez dives
for the first free-kick, not the one they score off, and he should be booked.
That’s cheating.
"Jay is honest, and doesn’t get his reward for being honest.
We haven’t had a penalty at this football club for over a year. And none of my
players are told to roll around."



Midfielder Aaron Ramsey says he is delighted with Arsenal's display against West Brom, but now he wants his side to be more consistent going forward.
"It was a fantastic performance by us tonight," he told Sky Sports. "After none of the results went for us at the weekend, we had to take full advantage of being at home, and we managed to do that.
"So it was important to get the win tonight. We want to make the Emirates a fortress, we have three wins here now and we want to build on that.
"We know what our qualities are, we know what we are capable of producing, it is just about producing that consistently."

FT: Mr Madley blows his whistle to signal an end to this MNF clash and Arsenal have comfortably won this game 2-0 thanks to goals in each half from club-record signing Lacazette, a win that moves Arsene Wenger's side up to seventh in the table.

90+3: SUB! Arsenal bring on Maitland-Niles for Ramsey for the final few seconds at the Emirates.

90: The fourth official says we will have an extra three minutes to play at the end of the second half.

90: SAVE! Lightening-quick break by Arsenal involving subs Ozil and Giroud, who then releases Ramsey on goal, but the midfielder's low drive is blocked by the feet of Foster.

87: SHOT! Giroud brings down a long ball over the top, before setting up Xhaka for a shot on goal from the edge of the box, only for the Swiss to blaze high over the bar.

86: It is just a question of whether the home side can add a third in the remaining few minutes, although that would be a tough harsh on their opponents.

84: Nothing comes from that right-wing corner though, with West Brom's giant back line headed the danger clear.

83: SUBS! Arsenal now make their first changes of the game as Giroud and Ozil come on for Lacazette and Alexis.

82: CLOSE! Arsenal work a corner from the right short to Bellerin and the right back's stinging drive is deflected over the bar.

79: Dawson crashes through the back of Alexis and on a yellow, the defender is more than a little fortunate not be booked again, but Mr Madley has taken pity on the player.



74: SUB! A third and final change by the visitors as Phillips replaces Nyom and the sub almost makes an instant impact by trying to pick out Rondon's run in the middle, only for Cech to intercept at his near post.


72: You cannot deny that Arsenal are well worth that second goal and it now looks a long way back for West Brom..

70: CHANCE! Alexis' wonderful ball over the top picks out the run of that man Lacazette, but after rounding Foster, the striker cannot keep his shot down. So nearly the hat-trick.

69: That second goal has really woken the home fans up at the Emirates, which is now rocking..

The France international keeps his cool from the spot as the striker beats Foster with a low shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the net, the player's fourth league goal for his new team.

66: PENALTY TO ARSENAL AND YELLOW! From that corner, Arsenal rework the ball from the right to the left wing and Ramsey is then barged over in the box by Nyom, who gets booked for that challenge.

65: Brilliant football by the hosts as Bellerin and Ramsey work a neat one-two down the right-hand side of the area, leading to a corner.

63: SUB! It is like London buses as Pulis now replaces Robson-Kanu with Rondon in attack.

62: SUB! West Brom make the first change of the game as Morrison replaces Livermore for the final half an hour at the Emirates.

60: An hour gone then at the Emirates and so far it has been all Arsenal in this second half.

57: West Brom's defence deal with the resulting free kick, clearing the cross from the left at the near post.

56: YELLOW! Krychowiak trips Elneny as the midfielder looks to get free near the left-hand corner flag, with the Pole getting booked for his troubles.

54: SAVE! Arsenal earn another corner, from the left, and Mustafi almost catches Foster out with a cheeky near-post flick.

52: Nothing comes from the resulting left-wing corner though as West Brom's back four clear their lines.

51: CLOSE! Swift Arsenal break sees Kolasinac find Elneny, who in turn sets up Lacazette for a shot, only for Gibbs to just get back in time to make a vital goal-saving block.


49: YELLOW! Dawson gets booked for hacking through the back of Alexis, meaning he and Evans now need to watch their steps in the second half.

What did Jamie Carragher think of the penalty shout in the MNF studio?
"That’s a penalty. The player has been too honest, if you
like, and the fact he gets up I think makes the decision for the referee. I
think if he stays down he probably wins a penalty."

48: The next goal is absolutely crucial in this contest, especially as West Brom cannot afford to go 2-0 down as Bellerin fires in a teasing ball from his station on the right, but none of his team-mates are there to take advantage.


46: OK we are back underway again after the break at the Emirates, with West Brom kicking off playing from left to right in the second half.

Former top-flight referee Dermot Gallagher has given us his view on West Brom being denied a penalty in the first half.
"I think it should [have been a penalty]," he said. "There’s a few
issues, has he seen it? I’m not sure he has seen it at first because Laurent
Koscielny comes across him.
"The second thing is, is he trying to play
advantage? What I would say is if he’s playing advantage I don’t think it’s the
wisest decision, however, if Cech hadn’t have save the shot and it had gone in
we would have said it was a brilliant advantage.
"And then of course the third
thing is it comes out to Jake Livermore and he can also put it in the net so
it’s almost too late to go back if he has played advantage. The simplest thing
would have been to have given a penalty. It’s not as easy as that on the day
though, he’s decided to go against that. I think stick to basics, give a
penalty and we wouldn’t be having this conversation."



HT: The second of the two extra minutes added on at the end of the first half are up and Mr Madley blows his whistle to signal an end to the first period, with Arsenal leading 1-0 thanks to Lacazette's 20th-minute strike.
However, West Brom have been a constant threat before the break and are more than a little unlucky not to be on level terms at the interval.

45+1: SO CLOSE! From that corner the ball gets cleared to Krychowiak and his lovely crossfield pass then picks out Gibbs' run and the full back's ball across the box is almost touched in at the far post by the stretching Barry after Bellerin failed to clear.

45: Gibbs finally curls the ball into the box, but Lacazette gets his head on to the ball at the near post, handing West Brom a corner.


FT: That's it! It could have been two or three in the end, but Liverpool won't care. Sadio Mane's late strike gives the Reds their first Premier League victory of the season.
Palace did have their chances at 0-0, and can take a lot from this, but Liverpool get their domestic season underway, just!

93: Palace work the ball nicely along the box, and Townsend spreads it to Dann, but he's offside! Huge waste for Palace!

92: SAVE! Hennessey again with a fine stop! Salah comes inside, opens his body up, and curls one for the top left corner, but Hennessey tips away!

90: Four minutes added on here.

89: CHANCE! Solanke is on the move and is found clear on the left of the box, but Hennessey is equal to it!
SAVE! Hennessey again is forced into a save to tip over Robertson's fierce effort!

87: Kaikai with a fierce effort from the edge, which Mignolet beats away, but there was a foul in there. Wouldn't have counted. 

85: Mane nearly gets on the end of a good ball from Henderson over the top.  Hennessey clears, Firmino looks to find the net from range, but the Palace keeper is back to gather quickly. 

83: Salah gets his head to Gomez's deep ball, but it's straight into the hands of Hennessey. Not enough power on the effort.

81: Salah looks to spread it towards Milner, but it's a wayward ball. Robertson and Matip have been superb for Liverpool this afternoon. 


79: Palace corner, McArhut delivers deep, but Mignolet is out to collect it well. The visitors still pushing.

77: Milivojevic is being withdrawn, Kaikai is on for the final 15 or so.

75: The Anfield crowd in full voice now. Palace are sitting back and perhaps Liverpool can grab a second now.

Liverpool FINALLY break the deadlock, but they have Milivojevic to thank for this one.
Robertson squares, Milivojevic takes control, but he's wrestled off the ball so easily by Solanke just on the edge of the box.
It fortuitously falls to Mane 10 yards out, and he drives it low past Hennessey!

71: CLOSE! Mane gets free into the area after Salah's good running. His effort is blocked, so is Wijnaldum's, and then Mane's second effort rolls into Hennessey's hands. 

69: Henderson shoves Loftus-Cheek from behind and picks up a yellow. Fantastic pace and power from Loftus-Cheek there.

67: Liverpool putting pressure on in the final third, but the end result is always a ball into the box. The latest, into Salah, is dealt with by Van Aanholt.

65: Van Aanholt is booked for dissent.  he was unhappy a throw in wasn't awarded to Palace. Him and Puncheon in the book now. 

63: Change for Liverpool; Sturridge is replaced by Mohamed Salah for his home debut.

61: SAVE! Mane moves inside with the ball from the right, slightly overruns it and leaves it for Henderson to shoot, but Hennessey is equal to it again, diving to his right to save! 

59: CLOSE! Firmino has no right to have a go after sneaking inside from the left touchline.  he looks for the top right corner, and it skims inches over!

57: CHANCE! What a chance for Palace!! Fosu-Mensah with a lovely ball to Loftus-Cheek on the right byline. He wrestles away from Klavan, gets to the byline and pulls it back for Benteke.
He simple HAS to score, the former Liverpool striker.  but he blazes it over the bar from eight yards!!

56: SAVE! Milner's corner is shouldered towards goal by Matip, but Palace just about clear.  it falls to Wijnaldum, and he hits a superb volley towards the bottom corner, but Hennessey stops it well to his right!

54: Milner steps up, but he's unable to pick out the top corner. A big groan across Anfield. 

53: Matip does like to get forward.  slick play on the edge of the box, and he's brought down by Fosu-Mensah for a free-kick
Shooting chance now.

52: Robertson lines up a cross after Henderson battles superbly to win the ball. But for the first time in this game, Robertson's delivery is too close too Hennessey. 

50: Mane with an intelligent slipped ball into Robertson's path, and he fiercely centres into the six-yard box. Again, Palace clear through Dann.
Liverpool have stormed out after the break here.

48: Milner takes, low towards the near post, Mane flicks it on, but Klavan can't get a foot to it!

47: Henderson finds Firmino at the byline, he centres looking for Sturridge and Mane in the box, but it's cleared for a corner by Dann again.

46: The teams are back out, and we're underway in the second half.


HT: That's the half. Goalless, but Liverpool's best moments have come from the left boot of Andrew Robertson.
I don't think either have done enough to deserve going in ahead.  can Liverpool step it up a gear in the second?

45: Liverpool surge forward but Dann is well placed to clear Gomez's ball from the right wing.
One minute added on.

44: Robertson has been the best player on the pitch so far. He cleans up in midfield there and plays it safe. 
But it's his attacking play on the left that has separated him from the rest.

42: SAVE! .  and have a chance of their own! Loftus-Cheek spreads it out to Puncheon in space, at a bit of an angle, and his left-footed effort is similarly beaten away by Mignolet!

41: SAVE! Firmino, with options either side of him, has a go from 25 yards, and forces Hennessey into a good save with a super strike!! He nearly caught out the Palace stopper there!
Palace break.

39: Sturridge takes, looks for the top right corner from the opposite angle, but it's off the wall and clear. 

37: Sturridge does well to win a free-kick just on the edge of the area from Puncheon's little touch. Needless.

35: Liverpool take it short to Robertson, and another brilliant ball from the former Hull man.  it finds Mane, but he doesn't expect it, and he has to work his feet quicker! It comes off his body and falls into the grateful hands of Hennessey!

34: Good from Robertson again. A low, early ball into the box forces Tomkins to clear for a corner. 

32: Dann caught offside in Liverpool's defensive third, wasted opportunity for Palace. Liverpool have had the better chance, but this game is rather equal at the minute.

30: Sturridge is playing very deep here, but that's testament to Palace's defending at the moment. Milivojevic is doing what he does best: protecting the defence. He intercepts well as Sturridge looked to get on the ball just inside the box.

28: Lovely, lovely spin by Daniel Sturridge around 35 yards out.  he takes on the shot with his left foot, but it's high and wide. 


26: Liverpool have had the best chance so far, but they've slowed down a tad in the last 10 minutes. Palace defending really well on both flanks and not allowing Milner or Robertson to get involved.

24: A few balls in the box by Palace as Benteke gets himself involved. Ward crosses, but Gomez just about clears at the far post. Better from Palace. 

22: Crucial tackle in the area by Henderson on Loftus-Cheek after Puncheon's centre. Liverpool were rushing out after Milivojevic's long-range free-kick hit the wall. 

20: Palace very compact here as Liverpool knock on the door. They get to a back five very quickly when Liverpool get on the ball. 
Mane nearly piles his way into the area to get a shot in, but Palace just about survive. 

18: Puncheon is booked for a challenge in midfield on Wijnaldum. He'll need to be careful now. 


Tony Pulis' Baggies overcome Bournemouth in what proved to be a comfortable win. Their threat from set-pieces proved to be the difference as Bournemouth just could not break them down. A great win for West Brom.

90+4: Fraser has a curled effort from outside the box but Foster makes an easy catch. Bournemouth have found it tough to really trouble Foster.


90+1: We've got five minutes of added time here. Can Bournemouth find an equaliser?

88: SUB! Jay Rodriguez, who has had a strong debut, comes off for Salomon Rondon.

87: King sprints down the wing and tries to get to the byline but Foster pushes the ball away from his feet for a corner.

84: OVER! From Robson-Kanu, who swivels and acrobatically rises to try and convert Livermore's loose pass inside the six-yard box.

81: YELLOW! For Rodriguez as he stamps on Fraser. Bournemouth have a free-kick on the left-hand side.
83: Fraser crosses in and Ake rises highest, but his header is easily caught by Foster. Dawson gets away without a yellow card after an off-the-ball incident on Ake.

79: SUB! Francis picks up a knock and is being substituted by Adam Smith.

78: Claims for a handball in the Bournemouth penalty area as Cook keeps his arm up in the air an unorthodox position and appears to touch the ball. 
There didn't seem to be too many appeals from the West Brom players and referee Madley waves play on.


76: GREAT TACKLE! Again by Ake. A sloppy pass by Cook leads to McClean breaking through on goal, but Ake gets in to make a slide tackle. West Brom corner.
77: The corner by Brunt causes chaos in the box but Ibe is able to dig it out and clear.

75: West Brom are playing long ball as Robson-Kanu helps bring his team-mates up the pitch with some impressive hold-up play. Robson-Kanu seems to have temporarily relieved the pressure.

71: SUB! Matt Phillips, who has impressed this afternoon, leaves the pitch for Hal Robson-Kanu.

On Soccer Saturday, Chris Kamara says Bournemouth are having all of the ball and West Brom are resorting to long-ball tactics.
"West Brom cannot get out of their own half. Poor old Jay Rodriguez is playing up front on his own and they are just launching it up from the back. He's got no chance of getting on the end of it."

70: SUB! 17-year-old Rakeem Harper comes on for Sam Field to make his debut.

68: It's not been Bournmouth's day so far. They're dominating possession but they seem to lack ideas of how to break West Brom down. Ibe tries to play a cross into the box from the right but the execution is poor. West Brom goal-kick.

65: Fraser swings in a free-kick for Bournemouth but his delivery lands straight into the gloves of Foster. He quickly sets Phillips away down the right but Cook intercepts his pass aimed for Rodriguez. 

63: SUB! Jermain Defoe comes on for Benik Afobe to make his second debut for Bournemouth.

60: Ibe wins a corner off Brunt, so now its their turn to attack a set-piece. Its played short to Fraser, who whips the ball towards King but his potentially dangerous shot is blocked by Hegazi before Fraser has a go. 
The Scotland international's strike smashes into the face of Dawson, who is now receiving some treatment from the physio. Despite the knock, he's fine to continue.

58: Jermain Defoe is warming up on the sideline for the Cherries. Can he turn this game around for the visitors?

56: OFF THE POST! Ibe is forced to head Rodriguez's cross behind for a corner. Yacob meets Phillips' drilled cross and he glances it off the post! Bournemouth are really struggling to deal with West Brom's set-pieces.

54: Phillips' cross is blocked by the sliding Daniels and West Brom have yet another corner. Referee Bobby Madley awards Bournemouth a free-kick for a foul on Begovic.

52: West Brom win a corner which Brunt crosses in, and Afobe has to head off the line! A lethal ball into the box.

50: Arter has a speculative strike from long range but it's nowhere near the goal.

48: Nyom drills a low cross into the box as he tries to pick out Rodriguez, but Ake slides in to make yet another crucial block.

46: And we're back under way at the Hawthorns. Bournemouth have made a substitution as Jordon Ibe comes on for Marc Pugh.


Ahmed Hegazi is having a Premier League debut to remember so far, having already got on the scoresheet for the Baggies despite being a centre back.

HT: West Brom take a deserved lead entering the break as they've been the far more lively team. Ahmed Hegazi will be delighted to have opened his account for the Baggies.

45: OVER! Surman has a shot from range but his curling strike goes harmlessly wide. 

43: An awkward, bouncing throw-in looks to be heading for goal but Foster gets his hands on it. Very strange.

42: GOOD SAVE! By Foster, who so nearly concedes a penalty! King beats Hegazi for pace but Foster is there to make a slide tackle on the tall Norwegian.

39: WIDE! Hegazi rises highest and makes contact with the corner before his header fizzes towards to Brunt, whose first-time shot goes just wide.

38: Bournemouth have responded well to going a goal down but are finding it difficult to find a way past West Brom's physical back four. 
West Brom look happy to counter-attack when the opportunity comes and they've now won a throw-in deep into Bournemouth's half. The throw aiming for Rodriguez is headed behind by Cook for a corner.

36: Livermore slides the ball through for Rodriguez on the counter-attack but Ake stays with him and makes another vital interception.

34: YELLOW! For Yacob who cynically pulls down Fraser who tried to surge past the Argentine.
35: JUST WIDE! The free-kick swung in by Fraser is met by Afobe at the near post, but his header deflects wide.

32: OVER! Hegazi, who came up for Brunt's disappointing corner moments ago, has a strike from just outside the box which goes narrowly over the bar.

It's a debut goal for the Egypt international! 
Nyom is caught by King on the left flank and West Brom were awarded a free-kick in a good crossing position. Brunt fizzes the ball towards the penalty spot and Hegazi is there to head in from close range. The Baggies take a deserved lead!

28: Solid defending by Bournemouth's £20m man Ake who makes a crucial tackle on Phillips to break up West Brom's counter-attack.

25: WIDE! West Brom are looking hungry for a goal. Phillips' overcooked cross lands to McClean on the opposite wing, but he drags his shot wide and into the side netting.


23: SO CLOSE! Rodriguez, who has been so lively this afternoon, cuts the ball onto his right foot but he curls his attempt just wide of Begovic's left post. That was inches away from being Rodriguez's first goal for the Baggies!

21: Dawson catches Afobe's ankle outside the box. Fraser swings the free-kick, on the left flank, in but Field can easily head the ball away from danger.

19: Bournemouth work the ball to Pugh, who picks out Fraser. He plays a low pass into the box aimed for Afobe, but Dawson can hoof clear.

16: Bournemouth enjoy their first real spell of possession and look keen to get the ball down the flanks as quickly as possible, but West Brom's defence are not budging.

14: OVER! Rodriguez meets the inswinging corner but he heads over. Begovic looked to be in no-mans land for a brief moment.

12: Bournemouth win a free-kick as Hegazi barges into the back of Afobe, who has looked a bit isolated up top in these early stages. They play it back but the ball ends up going to Rodriguez. Yet before he could break in to a one-on-one, Cook makes a crucial slide.
13: SHOT! Rodriguez shoots again, this time from outside the box but Begovic parries his effort out for a corner.

9: SAVE! A long throw into the box lands at the feet of Rodriguez, who stabs a shot towards goal but Begovic is there to make a smart, reflex stop.


ALL OVER! What a start to life in the Premier League for Huddersfield. Two goals for record-signing Mounie and an own goal from Ward was enough for a comprehensive victory on their debut at this level. Huddersfield are top of the Premier League! How long will they stay there? That is the question. Palace were not at the races. Much for Frank de Boer to ponder.

90+2: Van Aanholt curls a free-kick straight into the arms of Lossl. That will be that.

90: Three added minutes here. 

88: Poor free-kick from Puncheon, which barely reaches the wall. Sums up Palace's afternoon.

86: There will be no hat-trick for Mounie, as he is replaced by Rajiv van La Parra.

84: Benteke hangs in the air, but cannot keep the header down from a corner. Not been his afternoon.

82: Palace fans starting to leave in their droves here. Huddersfield fans having the time of their lives.

80: James Tomkins replaced Fosu-Mensah in the run-up to that Huddersfield third. "Premier League, you're having a laugh." bellows from the away end.

An instant Huddersfield hero. Great break from the visitors, Quaner pulls the ball back for Mounie on the run, who slots home from the edge of the box with aplomb. What a performance from the Terriers. As it stands, Huddersfield are top of the league!

75: Palace throwing everything at this now. They are committing bodies forward en masse. 

73: Loftus-Cheek is brought down on the run by Mounie who chased down his man, before upending the Chelsea loanee. Yellow card.

71: That s the end of Palmer's afternoon, with German forward Collin Quaner coming on to take his place.

69: Van Aanholt goes up for a challenge, leaves his arm trailing, but gets away with no booking.

67: Loftus-Cheek in a central role has really made a difference to Palace. He just needs some help from his team-mates.


65: Huddersfield in control really. They have defended superbly. Their travelling fans are in fine voice in the sunshine here.

63: TACKLE! Mounie is in, completely in the clear, but delays far too long, allowing Fosu-Mensah time to get back and slide in to save the day. Basic errors at the back for Palace must be of real concern to De Boer.

61: One Chelsea loanee in Loftus-Cheek is fouled, another is booked in the form of Palmer. 

59: SAVE! Zaha throws the step over, Schindler cannot get close to him, but Lassl is equal to it again, blocking a powerful low effort with his legs.

57: That's the end of the game for Smith. He is on a yellow card, so makes sense from Wagner. Danny Williams is on.

55: SAVE! Lossl brilliantly tips Benteke's powerful header round the post to keep the score at 2-0. Great attacking play from Benteke to meet a corner perfectly, but Lossl was equal to it.

53: TACKLE! Great challenge from Lowe to dispossess Zaha as he looked to be clean through. Great defending. 

51: CHANCE! Great football from Palace. Driving run from Loftus-Cheek, Townsend fires the ball across goal, but Benteke completely misses his kick, and Zaha cannot reach it at the back post. 

49: Loftus-Cheek has gone into a central holding role, with Townsend out wide. Still no joy for Palace.

47: CHANCE! Mounie really should have done better. Poor from Hennessey as he parries a long-range effort from Lowe out in front of him, Mounie elects to take a touch, which takes him wide, before firing over. Should have volleyed first time.

KICK OFF! Andros Townsend comes on forLuka Milivojevic who looked like he picked up a knock. We are back under way. Can Palace find a way back into this?



That's your lot for the first half here. What a start to life in the Premier League for Huddersfield. They have been at it from the get-go here, and Palace simply cannot cope with the Terriers' intensity. Huddersfield's first Premier League goal was an own goal, but the first goal scored by a Huddersfield player in over 10 hours of football was worth the wait, as Mounie rose highest before brilliantly powering a header into the net.

45+1: Great one-two between Zaha and Benteke, Zaha is in, but Lowe does superbly to hook the ball out for a corner. 

45: Two minutes of added time at the end of the first half.

43: Finally, a Palace shot on target. All Zaha's own doing, as he makes space for the shot but fires straight into the arms of Lossl.

41: Billing has been excellent for Palace in midfield. Very composed in possession. Palace still arguing among themselves. 


39: better from Palace. Still, no shot on target but they are starting to apply some pressure at least.

37: CHANCE! First real mistake from Huddersfield, Lowe miss-controls, Zaha takes it round Jorgensen but drills wide from a good position. He wants a corner, and replays show he is right. Big foot from Jonas Lossl.

35: Loftus-Cheek breaks clear, he has men in the middle, but Lowe does well to get back and make the block.

33: CHANCE! Jorgensen should really have hit the target. Mooy again with the corner, Jorgensen gets up highest, but heads wide. Poor marking again.



30: CHANCE! Ward gets caught on the wrong side of Ince, the Terriers' new boy is in, but Ward does brilliantly to dive in and make the recovering tackle.

28: First yellow card of the afternoon as captain Smith dives in on Van Aanholt and leaves referee Moss no choice but to brandish a card.

What a start! Great cross from Mooy, record-signing Steve Mounie leaps high above the Palace defence before powering a header into the net. Thoroughly deserved. Palace cannot cope with this intensity. 

A first Premier League goal, and it is an own goal! Still, it remains over 10 hours since a Huddersfield player scored a goal! Well-worked corner to the back post, Mathias Jørgensen diverts the ball back across goal, Ward is in the way, but can do nothing as the ball ricochets into the net.

21: Crunching tackle from Aaron Mooy, wins the ball, feeds Billing, who unleashes an effort from distance, but that is never troubling Hennessey.

19: Joel Ward has a heavy touch and Lowe is straight in to make the tackle. Huddersfield not letting Palace rest for a moment.

17: Superb ball control from De Boer on the touchline. Clearly, he has still got it. Great driving run from, Kasey Palmer, but he fires straight at Hennessey.

15: Great pass into Ince from Phillip Billing, Ince pulls the ball back across goal, but Scott Dann slides in to clear. Lovely move from the visitors.

13: Referee Moss having a word with Huddersfield captain Tommy Smith regarding some of the robust challenges flying in.

Super Sunday comes to a close. But don't worry, next Sunday we will have two more cracking matches as Everton take on Arsenal at 1.30pm before Tottenham face Liverpool at 4pm, both live on Sky Sports Premier League.

FULL REPORT HERE





Both sides are in the top half after picking up a point today.



90+5: Van Dijk heads away Hayden's strike. Newcastle corner. 
Ritchie plays an outswinger.  but Van Dijk can head clear once again.

90+3: GOOD CLEARANCE! From Van Dijk as Shelvey looked set to break into a one-on-one.

90: NASTY! Ritchie and Hayden clash heads as they both attempt to make a clearance. Both are slowly getting back on their feet.
We're going to have FOUR minutes of added time, although we may have slightly more time than that following the collision.

89: OFF THE LINE! Heroic clearance from Davis, who clears Lejeune's powerful header from a corner away from the goal-line.

87: Lejeune blocks Cedric's cross. Southampton corner. 
Bertrand whips the ball in and Elliot plucks the ball out of the air to make the catch. 

85: Bertrand plays a dangerous cross across the goal-mouth which Elliot does well to intervene and punch well away from danger.

83: Friend gives Hayden a talking-to after a heavy collision with Van Dijk but no card is issued.

81: SUBS! Charlie Austin comes on for Shane Long. For Newcastle, Jacob Murphy is on in place of Christian Atsu.

81: Newcastle win a free-kick on the edge of the box which Ritchie and Shelvey stand over. Ritchie tries to smash the ball into the top corner but it goes wide.

78: Ritchie appeals for a handball as his shot clatters into Van Dijk, who was standing in point-blank range. Friend says no penalty, which looked to be the correct decision.

76: YELLOW! For Gabbiadini after his protests towards Kevin Friend.

A superbly-taken penalty by Gabbiadini as he drills the ball into the top corner, past Elliot who dived the right way. Southampton are back in this!

74: PENALTY TO SOUTHAMPTON! A definite penalty as Lejeune clumsily trips over Long. Gabbiani stands over the spot-kick.

72: Long's cross is headed away by Lejeune before he clears Cedric's cross from the opposite flank. 
Southampton's attacks are becoming a bit too predictable for the Newcastle defence to deal with at the moment.

69: Newcastle have a free-kick on the right flank which Ritchie curls in.  Van Dijk heads it out to Lejeune, who boots his shot high and wide.

67: Van Dijk is hobbling a bit after colliding with Hayden, but he seems to have shrugged it off.
68: SUB! Dwight Gayle is on for Joselu.

66: OVER! Manquillo goes on a lung-busting run and sets up a Newcastle attack which ends with Atsu firing his left-footed strike over the bar.
67: SUB! Steven Davis comes on for Oriol Romeu.

64: Newcastle now playing with just one striker as Merino slots into central midfield in a 4-5-1 formation. Benitez seems to want to see this game out.


62: Atsu lays the ball off to Richie for a first-time shot on his left foot, but it deflects out for a corner which comes to nothing.
63: SUB! Merino, who signed for Newcastle permanently last week, comes on for Perez. 

60: NO PENALTY! Gabbiadini grabs hold of Lejeune's shirt in the box and goes down appealing for a penalty, but a spot-kick is not awarded and rightly so.

59: Newcastle have their whole team deep inside their own half as Southampton launch numbers forward. Cedric tries a hopeful attempt from range, but the ball goes out harmlessly for a goal-kick.

56: SUB! Sofiane Boufal comes on for Nathan Redmond.

54: NO RED CARD! Yedlin was already on a yellow card.  but he then slides in heavily on Redmond, and possibly should have been given his second of the afternoon. Referee Kevin Friend lets him off with nothing more than a lecture.

Already.  Newcastle have re-taken the lead! 
Ritchie slips a ball through to Perez. He fires a shot towards the near post that Forster parries, but he sends the ball straight back into the path for the Spaniard, who smashes in his second attempt!

An excellent solo goal by Gabbiadini!
Redmond plays an excellent pass for Gabbiadini, he expertly traps the ball down before running a ring around the Newcastle defence before slotting the ball into the bottom corner. A fine strike! Game on! 

48: OFF THE BAR! How bizarre! Perez crosses at the near post looking for Joselu before the ball ricochets off Yoshida and loops over Forster onto the crossbar!

46: And we're back underway! No substitutions for either side at half-time.



Newcastle lead in a half where Southampton have dominated possession and have played plenty of balls into the box, but no-one can convert. A solid defensive performance from Rafa Benitez's men so far.


43: Newcastle free-kick. There's signs of frustration from Gabbiadini as he has a slight tussle with Yedlin before the Italian gives him a little shoulder barge. No card is dished out for either player.

42: Some excellent Southampton passing play ends with Long having a strike which Lascelles blocks. Long then nods the ball into the path of Gabbiadini, but Elliot comes out to collect.


39: Another Southampton free-kick after Lascelles grabs Long around his neck. 
Bertrand crosses in and Van Dijk meets it but he doesn't attack the header and elects to try and cushion it instead, resulting in a simple clearance for the Newcastle defence.
40: Tadic picks up Bertrand's pegged-back pass and Lejeune is there to make a block.

37: Cedric pumps another cross into the box which Long tries to cushion a header back, but Lascelles nods clear. 
Moments later, Yoshida goes down after an aerial challenge with Perez. The Japan international is now up and back on his feet.


36: Long allows the ball to cross his body and tries a shot, but Hayden is there to get in the way.

34: Redmond tries to flick a pass through to Tadic, but Lejeune hoofs out for a throw. The Newcastle defence are standing strong.


All over at the Amex and Brighton's first Premier League game has ended in defeat. Sergio Aguero and Lewis Dunk's own goal did the damage.
An impressive performance from City, who dominated possession and created enough good chances to score a few more.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

87: Time is ticking away at the Amex and it looks like City are cruising to an opening weekend Premier League win. Brighton have played well today but it's not been enough.

83: SUB! Goalscorer Sergio Aguero gets a round of applause from the City fans as he is taken off, replaced by Premier League debutant Bernardo Silva.

82: YELLOW! Sterling goes into the book for a clumsy challenge on half way.

81: Dunk releases Knockaert with a brilliant long pass but the Brighton winger flops in the penalty area looking for a spot-kick and Michael Oliver is not buying it.

80: It is fired in low towards the near post but Fernandinho hooks it away for a corner, which Ederson then gathers when it's tossed into the middle.

79: Instant impact from Knockaert as he's bundled over in the corner by Sane. Here's an opportunity for Brighton.

78: SUB! Raheem Sterling replaces Jesus.

77: SUB! Final change for Brighton as Knockaert replaces March.

And there's the second goal.
Fernandinho delivers a fantastic cross from the right and Dunk inexplicably bullets a header into his own net. You're going to want to watch this one.
Ryan in goal could probably have saved the effort but it was a bizarre finish from Dunk, who was attempting to challenge Jesus in the middle.

75: CHANCE! They take the corner short and it's chipped in towards Silva at the back post, who cuts back but neither Fernandinho nor Stones can convert.

74: City are pushing for a second to kill the game now. De Bruyne and Walker have been combining well down the right and the England full-back wins a free-kick from Murphy.
De Bruyne's delivery takes a deflection and is up and out for a corner.

You can't give him a second chance! Aguero punishes Brighton this time, lifting his finish over Ryan.
It all came from a mistake by Stephens, who gave the ball away inside his own half. De Bruyne pounced, fed Silva, who in turn slipped a pass through to Aguero.

68: SUB! Here comes the first change for City as Danilo is replaced by Leroy Sane.

67: NO PENALTY! De Bruyne cuts inside and smashes a left-foot strike from 25 yards. It hits Dunk on the arm but it's by his side and referee Michael Oliver gives only a corner.

65: It looks like we are about to see Leroy Sane.

63: It could be a long 30 minutes to the final whistle for Brighton. City are camped in their half but so far the hosts are holding firm. It can't be long before we see substitutions from the visitors.


60: SUB! Brighton's second change of the game as Tomer Hemed is replaced by Glenn Murray.

56: CLOSE! Brighton nearly score! They keep the corner alive and the ball breaks to Duffy in the box, he takes a touch and fires towards the corner. It takes a slight deflection and flies inches wide. So close.
More City chaos from the next corner! Ederson drops the cross and Brighton have three chances, with Propper smashing the last one wide. Poor from Ederson.

55: Better from Brighton as Murphy leads a counter. A deep cross eventually comes in towards Propper but Danilo defends well to concede the corner. That's woken the Amex up.

53: CHANCE! A nightmare backpass by Duffy gifts a golden opportunity to Aguero but the striker takes too long, allowing Dunk to recover and in the end Aguero slices his finish well wide. Very unlike him.

52: NO GOAL! City have the ball in the net again - but again it won't count. Fernandinho chips a ball in behind to Silva and he is fractionally offside - very close - before teeing up Jesus to slot home. A good decision by the assistant.

51: City enjoy more extended possession deep inside Brighton's half before Fernandinho gets frustrated and drags a low shot that is easy for Ryan to collect.

48: Pep Guardiola has one impressive bench. Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and Leroy Sane are all warming up early in this second half. It would not be a surprise to see Sane or Sterling, City could do with more pace.

46: We are back under way.


Goalless at the break and Brighton will take that. The best chances have gone to City, with Jesus seeing a goal ruled out for handball.

45: THREE minutes of added time.

44: March does well and wins a free-kick after Silva lunges in down Brighton's right. This is an opportunity for Brighton to put in a quality ball.
45: Gross puts it into the middle and Dunk rises highest but his looping header is easy for Ederson.

42: CHANCE! Murphy nearly gets away from Walker and in on goal but Ederson is alert to the danger, sweeping up. That's just about the only thing the new City goalkeeper has had to do so far today.

39: It's all a little too intricate for City at the moment as they seek to play their way through Brighton's defence. The hosts have given up a couple of good chances so far but in general they have looked fairly solid in the face of City's possession.

34: SAVE! What a stop by Ryan! Aguero digs out a cross and Jesus is unmarked six yards out. The City forward plants a header towards goal but Ryan beats it clear and Jesus strikes the outside of the post on the follow-up. 
He should have scored but a great save by the new Brighton man.

31: Stephens nibbles at Silva again and it's another free-kick for City in a promising position. De Bruyne takes and it hits the wall, striking Bruno right in the face.

30: Jesus is back on and looks fine to continue.

29: YELLOW! Jesus is still receiving treatment off the pitch but he's been booked for that handball, which seems harsh. It was the right decision to disallow the goal but a booking seems excessive.

27: NO GOAL! Jesus bundles the ball past Ryan but Michael Oliver says the City forward used his hand. It's a great through ball by De Bruyne to find Jesus but the ball comes off his chest then off his hand and into the net.
Jesus takes a big whack to his throat from the goalkeeper for his trouble and he's down now, receiving treatment. 

24: Silva whips in a lovely cross but Stephens gets a crucial touch to concede a corner. City then make a bit of a mess of the delivery and Brighton break clear through March.


23: SUB! Brown hobbles off, he could be out for a number of weeks if it is a hamstring injury. Jamie Murphy is on to replace him.

22: This looks like bad news for Brighton as Brown has pulled up off the ball. He's receiving treatment now, it looks like a hamstring problem. His game could be over.

21: A bad mistake by new signing Propper almost lets City in but De Bruyne overhits his pass for Jesus and it's a goal kick. Propper has looked a little nervy in central midfield for Brighton.

19: Some respite for Brighton now as Stones bundles into Hemed on the half-way line and the hosts have a free-kick, with the chance to move up the field.
City have dominated 77 per cent possession so far.

17: SAVE! It's a decent effort with a fair amount of dip but it's straight at Ryan and the Brighton debutant takes it comfortably.

16: Silva, sporting a bold new look (pictures to follow) wriggles through a challenge and is upended by Stephens in a dangerous position on the edge of the Brighton area. De Bruyne is lining it up.

15: Pep is very animated on the edge of his technical area, he seems to be trying to pass a message to Kompany to get forward and join the attack.
The game has just slowed down after the two early chances for the visitors.

12: Walker is practically playing as a right winger at the moment, hugging the touchline. He has been very sharp in the early running.
Brighton are giving the ball away far too easily on those occasions they get possession.

9: It's all City now after that bright start for Brighton. Pep Guardiola's side are keeping the ball inside their opponents' half, making Brighton chase.
That's until Danilo cuts inside and fires a wild strike from 25 yards miles wide of Ryan's goal.


FT: And there's the full-time whistle! It's a third-straight Premier League win for Newcastle, and Jamaal Lascelles is the hero once again!
Make sure you stay around for the highlights from 5.15pm.  

90+3: WIDE! The attack breaks down and Newcastle look to play keep ball, but Stoke steal it and Martins Indi's cross is met by Diouf, who somehow heads it wide! What a chance for the visitors.

90+2: Zouma sends in a long throw. Choupo-Moting flicks it on but Crouch can't quite meet it. Still Stoke on the attack.  

90: Four extra minutes at St James' Park. Can Newcastle hold out? 

89: Clash of heads between Clark and Diouf... which results in a good old-fashioned drop ball.  Both players seem fine to continue.  

88: WHAT A MISS! Long ball played into the box and Crouch nods it down for Choupo-Moting, who somehow fires over from a narrow angle! He just needed more composure there.  Not quite able to live up to last weekend's heroics.

86: Ironic cheers as Crouch's first contribution is to give away a cheap foul on Merino.
Perez, who has had a solid afternoon for the hosts, makes way for Mo Diame. 

84: Perez puts too much on a cross and Stoke look to break with Shaqiri. Sobhi then works his way into the box after beating Yedlin a few times, butt then he just runs it out of play! How many times do you have to beat a defender?
Peter Crouch comes on to replace Allen.

82: Deliberate handball from Mbemba. Needless! And now Shaqiri has a chance from the corner of the box, 25 yards out or so.
It's well over! Much to the delight of the home fans.

. you score for the second straight weekend. Could it be another winner, too? 

78: And that is Joselu's afternoon over. A generous reception for the forward, who comes off for Dwight Gayle.
You can see the frustration on Joselu's face as he makes way. Onwards and upwards, son.

77: Another card for Attwell to dish out and this time it's for Merino, whose late lunge on Pieters is a cynical one. Stoke look to pump it forward but the ball is back with Elliot. 

75: Atsu tries to lay the ball on a plate for Joselu but Martins Indi slides in to get a touch on the low cross, and it's with Butland. 

73: Clark puts in a heavy challenge on Shaqiri and goes into the book for his troubles. Amid all the action, Jonjo Shelvey came on to replace Hayden moments ago.

71: St James' Park is bouncing now, but can Newcastle hold out this time? They certainly deserve the lead, but must shore up at the back to prevent Stoke from levelling again. 

Never mind whether it was a penalty or not.  Newcastle are back in the lead!
Ritchie's corner comes in and there is Lacelles six yards out. His header takes a huge deflection off Wimmer but the defender won't care.

67: NO PENALTY! St James' Park rages but Atsu has not been awarded a spot-kick.
"It's a big call," says Thommo in the Soccer Saturday studio, as Zouma gets the slightest of touches to the ball but brings down Atsu in one movement.
It needs a few replays to understand what's going on - so it's a brave decision from the referee.

64: BRILLIANT SAVE! Shaqiri's whipped ball in is met by Diouf, who heads it down into the ground and Elliot does brilliantly to tip it away. Great reactions from the Newcastle goalkeeper.

62: First sub of the day sees Jese replaced by Ramadan Sobhi. Not the best of afternoons for Jese, who has plenty on his mind off the pitch of course with his newborn son remaining in hospital after being born prematurely.


60: OFFSIDE! Almost the perfect response from Newcastle, but Perez is in an offside position as he tucks the ball away following Clark's acrobatic effort. 

From nothing, Stoke are level! And the hosts are punished for not extending their lead.
Allen finds Shaqiri 30 yards out, and the Swiss brings it forward before curling a low left-footed effort into the bottom corner. Elliot dives to his right but can't get to it and the Potters are all square.

56: Short corner is back with Ritchie - it falls for Perez who sees his shot deflect wide.
The corner is swung in and it's headed high into the air. Butland is forced to tip it over for another corner.  Merino meets it on the edge of the area but it's blocked.

54: Despite that chance for Stoke, Newcastle are certainly on top. Martins Indi is forced to put the ball out for a corner.

52: SAVE! Decent stop from Elliot, who parries away Shaqiri's snapshot from the edge of the area. Both he and Choupo-Moting went for it, but I think it was just the Swiss who got in first.

49: Have to feel for Joselu. How many more chances will he get?!
He came out with a point to prove against his former employers, but it hasn't been his day so far. To say the least. 

47: ANOTHER CHANCE! It's a THIRD chance for Joselu against Stoke!
He should have a hat-trick against his old side, but the wait goes on.
Atsu finds Joselu in acres space in the middle, and a decent first touch takes it into the box, but his second flashes a shot over from 15 yards out. 

Enjoy your break? Good. Stoke get the second half underway, and no doubt Mark Hughes will have had something to say about that opening 45.

Newcastle are now just 2/7 to hold on to the victory with
Stoke priced at 14/1 while the draw is a 4/1 chance. Among the various Price Boosts is a 2-0 Newcastle win at 4/1, and Jese to score next at 16s, while Atsu is 15/2 to add to his own tally.

HT: And there's the half-time whistle. A decent start from Stoke, but after falling a goal down, they're lucky to still be in this one. 
Christian Atsu got the ball rolling for the hosts, but Joselu missed a couple of glorious chances, while Lascelles should have nodded another one in for Rafa's men. As it is, it's all to play for in the second half.

45: Just the one minute added on in this first half.  

44: Shaqiri sends Diouf chasing for the ball out wide on the right, and he gets to it just before it goes out for a goal-kick, but the cross is just behind Choupo-Moting in the middle.

42: Ritchie floats in another free-kick but this time it evades everyone and bounces wide. 
Disagreement between Clark and Shaqiri, who protests to the referee after the Newcastle defender holds onto the ball to delay the Stoke throw-in. Mountain, molehill and all that.

40: Stoke need to find a spark from somewhere, and Hughes has opted for Choupo-Moting to play through the middle now with Jese out wide. Will it work? We'll have to find out.

38: Newcastle continue to look strong but it's not quite Joselu's day so far.  his misplaced pass breaks down the attack.

35: GREAT SAVE! Another chance comes and goes for Newcastle, and for Joselu once more!
A short corner finds Yedlin 30 yards out, his shot takes a couple of deflections and it falls to Joselu's feet, but he cannot send it past Butland from 15 yards out. Another big chance for the hosts.

33: Well what an action-packed last 10 minutes or so.  Newcastle very much on top now and they will look to put this game beyond Stoke, who started brightly but failed to create a clear chance - bar Shaqiri's near moment of brilliance. 

31: Yellow card for Wimmer - the home fans want more but it's the right call. Yedlin touches it beyond Wimmer out wide, but the Austrian had already committed and he brings the Newcastle defender crashing back down to earth.
Free-kick out wide for the hosts.  but it's far too close to Butland. 

28: JUST WIDE.  AGAIN! A big chance for Joselu against his old club!
It's an amazing ball in from Mbemba, who finds Joselu unopposed. Perhaps he could have taken a touch, but his first-time shot sails wide of the far post. Newcastle really should be a couple goals up.

26: And there is the yellow card for Hayden, who was warned after just four minutes and now goes in late from behind on Allen. No excuses. 

24: GREAT SAVE! A chance from nothing for Shaqiri, who cuts onto his left foot 30 yards out and whips a curled effort which looks destined for the top corner. However, Elliot tips it wide with a terrific save. The corner is met by Choupo-Moting but it's out for a goal-kick. 

22: JUST WIDE! So close to a second for Newcastle! It's a terrific corner from Ritchie and Lascelles meets it but heads wide from six yards out! Really was a great chance to go two clear. 

Terrific ball this from Ritchie out on the right. His cross swings towards the back post and is met by Atsu, who beats Diouf to slot home and score his first ever Premier League goal.

PIC! At least Stoke boss Mark Hughes was able to shake hands with opposite number Rafa Benitez, but will that be the case at the full-time whistle though?

16: Newcastle look for a quick counter attack but Wimmer is wise to it as he dispossesses Ritchie at a key time. The hosts back on the ball though and they will look to get into the ascendancy. 

14: Great play from Perez down the right for Newcastle and he gets the ball to the byline. However, the cross is low and too close to Butland.  

12: Stoke on top, but few chances created so far. Shaqiri has been heavily involved already. He scored the winner back in 2016 when these two last met in the league - can he do it again?

10: The cross comes to nothing for Stoke, but they continue to enjoy the majority of possession at St James' Park. The hosts, despite that early shot from Ritchie, need to pick it up a little bit.

8: Choupo-Moting strikes from 25 yards out and if deflects wide for a corner. Stoke play it short but then it goes back to the halfway line.  Shaqiri then rolls around for some time after a tackle from Yedlin. Free-kick to Stoke which they will look to cross in. 


FT: Cracking game as Liverpool were made to sweat to hold on. This win breaks a run of four games without a winbut they were indebted to Simon Mignolet, who saved a Jamie
Vardy penalty with 20 minutes remaining. Philippe Coutinho scored a stunner in the first-half and looks back to his best. You can see how much this wins means to Klopp - he looks fired up at full-time celebrating with his fans and players. Stay tuned for highlights. 

90+5: FREE-KICK! Last chance here. Oxlade-Chamberlain fouls Gray about 30 yards out down the right. Gray to whip this one in..
Gomez heads clear! There's the whistle. 

90+4: Liverpool seeing this one out very shrewdly at the moment. Leicester can't get the ball!

90+2: Liverpool enjoy a spell of possession and take the sting out of the game. Vardy shows his frustration by charging in late on Moreno. Yellow card. 

90: FIVE MINUTES ADDED ON!

88: Leicester win a throw deep in attacking territory. Chilwell launches a long-throw into the mixer.. Maguire wins the flick on and it drops to Gray about 15 yards out. but the referee blows for a foul. Liverpool can clear.

86: Milner slides in to make a challenge. He stays down, holding his ankle. He'll need to carry on as Liverpool have made all their subs. He's soldiering on. 

84: SHOT! Liverpool certainly not shutting up shop. They want the fourth. Wijnaldum drives forward and moves the ball onto his right. He tries his luck from 20 yards but it fizzes wide of the far post. 

80: CLOSE! Salah makes good yards down the right and dribbles into the box. His cross is fizzed into the middle, looking for Sturridge but Schmeichel dives at full-stretch to push it clear. 

77: SUB! Coutinho - who has looked back to his best - is replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain.

74: PENALTY APPEAL.. NOT GIVEN!! Still Leicester knock on the door. Gray dribbles down the right wing and chips a ball into the middle. Can makes a block. The ball hits his arm, which is at an awkward angle.. the home fans wants ANOTHER penalty but Antony Taylor says no. Looked a good shout.


72: MIGNOLET SAVES VARDY'S PENALTY!!! A quite breathless five minutes culminates in Mignolet denying the Leicester striker. He stays down the middle and Vardy smashes it straight at him. Obviously done his research the Liverpool goalkeeper. Great stop. 

70: PENALTY TO LEICESTER!! UNBELIEVABLE! VARDY FOULED BY MIGNOLET!! Vardy chases another lost cause and Mignolet comes flying out of his goal. There's a coming together and the striker looks at the ref. Anthony Taylor points to the spot. Mignolet is booked.

Leicester hit back immediately. Jamie Vardy loves playing Liverpool. This is all about Gray. He smacks a wonderful attempt from a tight angle that Mignolet claws to safety. but only to Vardy, who heads home from close range. Two goals in 90 seconds. 

The skipper delivers! Vardy nearly sneaks in down the channel at one end, but Matip crowds him out. From there, Liverpool hit on the counter. It's a four on three and Sturridge makes the right pass. Henderson sets himself and rolls home. Big goal for the visitors.

64: Leicester are going more direct where possible now. They win a free-kick about 40 yards out and send the big boys up. Morgan wins the second ball inside the area but is penalised for a foul. 
65: SUB! Sturridge replaces Firmino. 

61: SUB! Mahrez, who has been quiet, is replaced by Gray. 

59: Liverpool take the sting out of the game with a good spell of possession. Salah tries to wriggle free in the area but his pass for Firmino is cut out by Morgan. Leicester look to be readying a change...

56: CHANCE!! Liverpool win a corner. Coutinho whips in a tasty delivery and Lovren battles with Maguire. He looks to have got the better of the Leicester man but he header is well off target. Lovren is fuming with the referee as he feels he was fouled. He gets a booking for his troubles.

54: Chilwell is OK to continue. Leicester certainly on the front-foot, too. Simpson goes direct and pings a long ball in towards Okazaki. Mignolet comes off his line and makes a solid punch. Liverpool get it clear.

52: INJURY! Chilwell lands awkwardly after an aerial duel with Gomez. The Leicester physio is on and the magic sponge is applied.

50: That goal seems to have lifted Leicester, who have a spring in their step now. Henderson is crowded out in midfield. Leicester get possession back and try to build...

47: SHOT!! Liverpool work the ball down the right. A ball finds Coutinho lurking at the back post and he takes on the first-time volley. He controls the shot well but it's straight at the goalkeeper. 

45: We are back. Cliche alert - the next goal is massive. Liverpool have started brightly...  


HT: He's
back! Coutinho stole the show here with a trademark free-kick from 30 yards. It
was a stunner. That was Liverpool's second after Salah had headed them in
front. They've been clinical and deserve their lead, but have made life much harder for themselves, conceding that late Okazaki goal. All to play for in the second period. 

What a half! Leicester are back in it as Liverpool's set-piece woes come back to haunt them. Mignolet had to be alert to push over a Vardy header but Leicester score from the resulting corner. Mignolet comes and makes a flaky punch, it hits Gomez and dribbles towards the goal-line. Okazaki is there to poke it home from a yard out. Liverpool want a foul on their goalkeeper, but nothing given. Game on.


45: Two minutes added on here.
45+2: YELLOW! Vardy chases a lost cause down the right and Matip needlessly pushes him in the back when Mignolet had it covered. Clear booking. And Leicester have a free-kick on the left-edge of the box...

43: CHANCE!! Liverpool break. Firmino finds space inside the area down the left and strikes a right-footed effort towards the far post. Coutinho is charging in but can't quite get a touch. The ball flies two yards wide.

40: CONTROVERSY! Okazaki puts the ball in the net. but it's chalked off for offside. A free-kick is knocked down by Maguire into the path of Okazaki, who was five yards offside from the original ball but level from Maguire's touch. He hammers it home, but the linesman flag cuts short the celebrations. 
Tough on Leicester - although on second viewing, the lino may have flagged for Maguire being offside, which looked a correct call. 

38: It's been a turbulent few months for the Brazilian - but he's back doing what he does best. Has bossed this game.

36: SHOT! First attacking signs from Chilwell, who receives a bouncing ball from Albrighton. He thumps a half-volley from a tight angle towards goal but Mignolet gets down quickly to grab and hold on.

34: Midfield battle has been the key word in the last few minutes. Henderson and Ndidi have been fighting for the ball in midfield during a scrappy period. Leicester need to get service into Mahrez - it looks their only way back into this one. 


31: That Leicester pressure has now subsided with the visitors back bossing the ball. Firmino and Coutinho try to link up on the edge but Maguire gets a big boot in the way. 

28: Once again, Leicester have responded with attacking oomph. Mahrez tries to burst his way down the right but his final ball is lacking. Vardy tries to get in behind but is flagged offside. Liverpool will surely create plenty on the break here. 

PERFECTION! That's world-class from the Brazilian. 
It's almost identical to the one he scored against Arsenal last season, whipping a ball from right-to-left away from the diving goalkeeper. Splendid! We'll have the video for you shortly. You must watch. 

22: FREE-KICK!! Henderson kick-starts a fantastic counter with a ball to Moreno. He darts towards goal but is taken down by Ndidi. He gets booked and this is perfect range for Coutinho - about 25 yards out, dead centre..

17: Good response by Leicester. They get up the pitch and press Liverpool deep inside their own box. King sends over a corner but Henderson heads clear. 

He missed the easy one, but finds the net with the difficult one. Coutinho whips a deep ball towards the back post, which looks like going out of play. However, Salah believes and meets it with a reverse header - right on the by-line and manages to direct it past Schmeichel, who got his angles all wrong!

13: POST!!! Liverpool pen Leicester back. Can pings a powerful low effort towards the bottom corner which cannons back off the foot of the woodwork. It drops eights yards out to Salah, who is surely going to tap this one home.. no! He somehow side-foot's it about four yards wide! Klopp's men should be ahead. 

9: Liverpool enjoy a bit of pressure. Coutinho whips a ball in which is headed over his own bar by Simpson. The corners comes to nothing. Easy take for Schmeichel.

6: CHANCE!! Liverpool cut open. Okazaki releases Vardy down the left, who beat a wonky Liverpool offside trap. He bares down on Mignolet but the goalkeeper pushes his effort clear. It bounces to Mahrez about 10 yards out but he can't control the effort. Well over. Worrying signs for the visitors. That was too easy. 

3: SHOT! Liverpool build through Coutinho - he finds Can down the right who has two bites at the cherry to cross. His second attempt is a cross/shot but Schmeichel holds on.

2: Shocking opening pass from Lovren, who under no pressure shanks on straight out of play when trying to look for Moreno. Nervy.

1: Here we go! Can Liverpool arrest a run of four without a win? Will Leicester back up their impressive midweek result? All will be revealed. The visitors kick-off. 

The King Power rise to their feet to feet to welcome both teams. Jamie Vardy has a cheeky look in his eye - maybe he fancies his chances against Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren, who are reunited at centre-back. 
It's nearly time..

We are close to kick-off. The teams are about to make their
way into the tunnel. Here’s a reminder of the line-ups:
Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Maguire, Chilwell,
Albrighton, Ndidi, King, Mahrez, Vardy, Okazaki
Liverpool: Mignolet, Gomez, Matip, Lovren, Moreno,
Wijnaldum, Henderson, Can, Salah, Coutinho, Firmino


It's all over. Manchester United's perfect start to the season comes to an end. Choupo-Moting with both goals for Stoke while Rashford and Lukaku netted for the visitors.
Stay tuned for highlights. 

90+4: SHOT! Half a chance for Pogba as the ball breaks to him in the box and he swipes at it, but he can't keep it down.

90+1: SAVE! Oh what a stop from Butland. 
A corner is swung into the middle and it's Zouma who flicks it towards his own goal, forcing Butland to make a fantastic one-handed save almost on the line.

90: Three minutes to be added on.

88: It's the visitors who are rushing a bit more, trying to make something happen to break the deadlock. Time is running out though.

86: A long ball into the United box almost falls for Diouf, but it's cleared before he can get off a shot. Stoke are still posing the occasional threat.

83: Final switch for United as Mkhitaryan is replaced by Lingard.

81: CHANCE! What a an opportunity for Lukaku. It's a brilliant ball from Martial out on the right, bending it between two defenders for Lukaku, but the striker shoots over the bar from 10 yards out.
He didn't catch it cleanly - looked like it came off his ankle.

80:It's still Manchester United doing most of the pressing, but without much success so far. They have, for most of the game, found it tough to find a way through Stoke's packed defence.

77: Pogba checks inside around 30 yards out and hits a low effort that is straight at Butland. 
Stoke have got players behind the ball again and are making it difficult for United.

75: Second change for Stoke as Jese is replaced by Berahino.

74: United have scored plenty of late goals already this season and they have started to take some control of the game again. They are pressing and probing and pushing Stoke back.

72: Here are the United changes and it's Rashford and Herrera who make way for Martial and Mata.

70: United are preparing a couple of changes. Martial and Mata getting set to come on. Wouldn't be surprised if Rashford was replaced as it hasn't quite happening for him in the second half.


67: SHOT! Valencia tries his luck with a 30-yard effort and drills a low shot narrowly wide of the post.

66: What a response from Stoke. Who will seize the initiative now? The home fans are really getting behind their team.

Just as United responded quickly to Stoke's opener, the hosts have hit back after falling behind. It's poor defending from Jones from a corner as he leaves Choupo-Moting all alone to head in from six yards out.

63: SAVE! Wow. What a stop from De Gea. Jese must have thought he scored as he flicks a cross towards goal, but De Gea makes a fantastic reaction stop to turn it over the bar.

61: The United goal came after Jese had surged forward from inside his own half, but he took it on too far when he should have released a team-mate earlier. That put Allen in a tricky position and when the ball was lost it went straight up the other end and into the back of the net.

59: Bright run from Rashford down the right but, with support in the middle, he takes a heavy touch and loses the ball as he cuts inside.

United ahead against the run of play. Stoke are caught on the ball and Mkhitaryan slips a clever pass through the defence for Lukaku. His first shot is saved by Butland but the striker doesn't miss the rebound.

55: Whatever Mark Hughes said at half-time has had an impact. Stoke are seeing more of the ball and have really limited any threat from United.

52: Stoke have made a more positive start to the second half and are playing on the front foot. 
United haven't really got going, probably to this man's disappointment.

50: Almost a chance for Stoke from a corner as it hits Jese and he doesn't have time to react and turn it in.

49: Well worked by Stoke in the final third until the final ball, which is lofted into the box and headed away by Darmian. Butland started the Stoke move and Shaqiri was involved with a clever pass across the pitch.

47: Zouma was solid in the first half for Stoke and he's called into action again to block a shot from Rashford after Pogba spun clear in midfield.

It's United who get the game restarted.

There's a change for Stoke as Martins Indi comes on for Cameron.



Hit play for a look at the best action from the opening 45 minutes.

There's the half-time whistle. All square the break. United dominated possession but had to come from behind late in the half after Stoke struck through Choupo-Moting.

A swift response from United. A corner is flicked on at the near post by Matic and Pogba's header hits Rashford and goes in.

For all United's possession this half, it's Stoke's first real prolonged spell on the ball that ends with the opening goal.
They work it well in the final third before Fletcher switches it out to Diouf on the right of the box. Bailly and Jones have somewhat switched off and Diouf crosses for Choupo-Moting to sweep in from six yards.

41: Stoke are making this difficult for United with the way they are defending, but the hosts are struggling to get out. When they do get the ball the passes aren't sticking often enough.

39: After playing a few set-pieces short, United decide to try and get one in the box, but Matic's delivery from the free-kick is poor and doesn't beat the first man.

37: Haven't seen much of Jese so far for Stoke. He probably hasn't been helped by the fact that Stoke have spent most of the match in their own half.

34: Valencia gets in behind in the right channel and puts in a decent-looking cross, but it's just got too much on it for Lukaku. United still not finding a finishing touch.

31: Just like at the start of the game, a flurry of chances and then the game slows down a little. 

28: SAVE! Rashford gets a bit of space in the box so looks for the far corner with a snap-shot. Butland does well, though, not only saving but pushing it away from Lukaku.

27: SHOT! Stoke's best move of the match ends with Shaqiri getting off a 25-yard shot that is well saved by De Gea. It was heading for the bottom corner.

25: CHANCE! Super run from Rashford. He bursts across and through the defensive line and is played in by Bailly as he steps up into the Stoke half.
Rashford gets a shot off from the angle but Butland saves with his legs. Decent effort by Rashford as Zouma went flying in with a sliding tackle.


23: A rather pensive look on the face of Jose Mourinho, who has not won on his last three visits to Stoke as a manager.
United haven't threatened so far, nor have Stoke. Zero shots on target between them.

20: Better from United as Lukaku gets down the right channel and puts in a low cross which Pogba flicks goalwards, but it's blocked by Zouma. 

19: Optimistic effort from Choupo-Moting as he appears to spot De Gea off his line so whacks a half volley goalwards from around 35 yards. It's dipping. but nowhere near enough.

17: There's not much happening for United in the final third at the moment, highlighted by a pass over the top from Herrera that doesn't go anywhere near another black shirt.
After a fast start, this game has certainly slowed down.

15: Almost an opening for Stoke as Choupo-Moting wins the ball in the left corner and puts in a deep cross, but Darmian does well to head away with Diouf putting him under pressure.

FT: Late goals
by Troy Deeney and Tom Cleverley saw Watford come from behind to beat Arsenal
2-1 and go fourth in the Premier League.
Arsenal had
appeared on course for all three points after taking the lead six minutes
before the interval when Per Mertesacker, making his first start for 18 months
in place of the injured Shkodran Mustafi, headed in Granit Xhaka’s corner.
However, the
home side drew level in controversial circumstances when Richarlison
went over in the box under Hector Bellerin’s challenge, with Deeney smashing
home the resulting spot kick.
Marco Silva’s
side then recorded their first home win of the season when Cleverley fired home
after a mad scramble in the box, a result that sees Arsenal in sixth in the
table.

INCREDIBLE! Cleverley's first Watford goal for over seven years looks to have given his side all three points after a mad scramble in the Arsenal box, with the ball eventually falling to the midfielder 10 yards out and he smashes it home into the roof of the unguarded net.

90: The fourth official says we will have an extra four minutes to play at the end of the second half.

88: SHOT! Carrillo fires a well-struck shot just over the bar from 25 yards out as Watford go in search of all three points.

85: SUB! Arsenal now make their third and final change as Holding replaces the limping Koscielny.

83: POST! Deeney lays the ball off to Capoue on the edge of the area, but the substitute's shot deflects off Mertesacker and past Cech, but on to the outside of the far post.

80: SUB! Watford make their third and final change as Capoue replaces Pereyra for the final 10 minutes.



77: Having seen the TV replays, there is no doubt Watford are more than a little fortunate to be level after that dubious penalty decision by Mr Swarbrick, with Richarlison's simulation fooling the referee.

75: SHOT! Richarlison pulls a shot from the left edge of the are just past Cech's near post.

And Deeney smashes home his first goal in 14 league games as the Watford captain brings his side level from the spot.

71: PENALTY TO WATFORD! Bellerin brings down Richarlison in the box and the ref points to the spot..

70: SAVE! Another important stop by Gomes to deny Ozil's close-range effort, but the German really should have scored.

68: SUB! Arsenal now swap Lacazette with Giroud in attack.

67: So it looks like Watford have now reverted to a flat back four following those recent substitutions.

64: And Watford's back four just about deal with the threat from the resulting corner.

63: SAVE! Ozil slides Iwobi through on goal, but from a tight angle towards the left of the box, Gomes gets fingertips to the midfielder's goalbound shot.
YELLOW! Kabasele got booked for fouling Lacazette in the lead-up to that chance.

62: SUBS! Watford bring on Deeney and Carrillo for Gray and Mariappa with Silva having seen enough in this second half.

62: Meanwhile, Arsenal's defence hold firm to clear that subsequent corner.


61: SUB! And Welbeck cannot continue, with Ozil coming on to replace the forward.

59: Important punch by Cech at the far post, albeit at the expense of a corner, but worryingly for Arsenal Welbeck is down with an injury.

57: As Watford push more men forward, Arsenal are looking more and more dangerous on the break as Gomes rushes out to just get to the ball ahead of Welbeck.


54: Quick break by Arsenal, but Bellerin's final ball is disappointing and Watford survive.

52: SHOT! Better by Watford as Richarlison, on the left, cuts inside on to his right foot, before bending a shot just past the far post.


51: Arsenal win the first corner of the second period, but this time Xhaka's delivery from the left is poor and Arsenal clear the ball at the near post.

49: Already in the early stages of the second period it looks like Watford are going to go a little longer after the break.

PIC! So it is Mertesacker's 39th-minute header that separates these sides.

46: OK, we are back underway again after half-time at Vicarage Road..


HT: The whistle goes for half-time and it is Arsenal who lead at the break thanks to Per Mertesacker's first Premier League goal since December 2013 on the captain's first start of the season.


45: The fourth official says we will have three extra minutes to play at the end of the first period.

44: SAVE! Xhaka now tests Gomes again with a low drive from just outside the box, but the Brazilian is there to beat the ball away.

43: CHANCES! Two chances for Arsenal as first Xhaka sees his shot from the edge of the area pushed to safety by Gomes, before Arsenal rework the ball, only for Bellerin to slice wide of the gaping goal from six yards out.

42: Incredibly, that was Arsenal's first away goal in the league this season.

From Arsenal's first corner of the game, swung in from the right by Xhaka, Mertesacker rises high above Cleverley to power a header home from six yards out on the captain's first start of the season.

38: It is safe to say that Arsenal have been misfiring in this first period without the likes of Alexis, Ramsey and Ozil.

36: Good hands by Gomes as the Brazilian grabs Iwobi's cross at his near post, but better that by the Gunners.

33: Neither team have had a shot on target so far in the game...  it has been that kind of contest I'm afraid. 

PIC! Cleverley (left) and Kolasinac compete for the ball at Vicarage Road.

29: CLOSE! Elneny shifts his feet nicely, before firing a 25-yarder inches over Gomes' bar - wow that was close.

28: The build-up has all been too slow as far as Arsenal are concerned in this first period.

26: The first goal is going to be absolutely crucial in this tight encounter.

23: Midway through the first half and it is Watford who are just starting to step up the tempo in the last five minutes or so as Femenia whips in a tempting cross that just evades Pereyra in the six-yard box.


PIC! It has been a closely matched affair so far in the first period at Vicarage Road.

19: CHANCE! Doucoure holds off Bellerin down the left, before firing in a ball that glances the head of Pereyra in the six-yard box. If the forward could just have got a bit more on that header..

A dramatic afternoon at St James' Park but Tottenham have got their Premier League campaign off to a winning start. 
As for Newcastle, the result arguably posed more questions than answers, with plenty to improve on ahead of next weekend's match with Huddersfield. 
Hit play on the video below to see highlights from the game. Until next time!

Hear from Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino following the game.


Hear from Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez following the match.


Alan Pardew has managed Jonjo Shelvey in the past and had this to say about the red card following the game.
"I have been his manager. You have to have chats with Jonjo and he
has a very short fuse over tiny little incidents like that. What irritates me
is it isn’t stamp like he’s going to hurt him, it is a petulant stamp. 
"That is
the sort of thing that you have to ask him about in training on Monday - ‘what
are you doing? Why are you doing it? You are the captain of the football team
and you have to set an example not just for your team-mates but for everyone watching
around the world’ and that’s the responsibly the has to understand in that
role."


"We knew it was going to be a physical game today. They didn’t
make it easy for us and it’s a difficult place to come. We knew if we stuck to
the game plan then the chances would come. They did and we put them away.
On Shelvey's red card: "It happens sometimes in football. He’s a great player and I’m
sure he’s going to be disappointed. It was important that we stayed professional and just did what we knew we had to do. We kept the ball moving which was difficult
at times but I don’t want to talk about it too much.
"I’ve had a few talks with the gaffer and a couple of people.
I’ve been caught out a couple of times with my temper. It’s something I like to
keep in my game and it was a game today when we had to keep our cool. We didn’t
want to get too heated up and get pulled into what they wanted us to and make
it more of a physical battle than a game of football."

Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness has his say on Jonjo Shelvey's red card
"Absolutely none [defence for the ankle stamp]. He’s gone from captain to clown in ten seconds.
He’s annoyed, so what, because Alli has kept the ball. How stupid is that?
Newcastle are right in the game, he’s done it right under the referee’s nose
who has no other alternative but to send him off."


After a quiet first half, the second was certainly more dramatic and it all started with a sending off for Jonjo Shelvey after he stamped on the ankle of Dele Alli. 
The Spurs man then hurt Newcastle even more as he scored the opening goal before Ben Davies added the second not long after. 
Stay tuned for highlights in 15 minutes! 

90+2: OFF THE POST! August just isn't Kane's month as Son powers through the middle of the park, tapping into the path of the striker but his effort smashes off the upright and goes wide. 
OFFSIDE! Kane has the ball in the back of the net after some great play between Eriksen and Son, but the latter is flagged for offside. 

90: Three minutes added on.

89: Spurs are just seeing the game out now, passing the ball between themselves with only a few minutes to go.
Final change for Spurs as Dembele is replaced by Harry Winks. 

86: Free kick to Newcastle and a yellow card for Davies as he fouls Ritchie on the right of the field. 
He takes it himself and it's a decent effort that picks out Clark at the top of the box and he tries the volley, but Lloris holds it well. 

Ben Davies has now scored more goals in his last two games for Spurs than he did in his first 89.

84: CLOSE!! So nearly a goal back for Newcastle to make it a nervy end for the visitors. Hayden whips an inviting ball across the face of goal and it meets the incoming Atsu at the back post, but he is pressured by the Spurs defence and his sliding poke can only find the side of the net.
The best effort Newcastle have had all game. 

82: Another change for Spurs as Alli - who is roundly booed by the home fans - is replaced by Victor Wanyama. 
He takes his time in going off which only angers the home fans more. Does he care? Probably not.

80: Guys, Lloris is still on the pitch! Who knew. He has barely been tested in the second half but he makes two easy collections in quick succession. 
SAVE! Another save from the Frenchman, this time it has a bit more vigor as Atsu makes a superb run into the box, going around Alderweireld before shooting - but the Spurs captain is down low to keep him out.

78: SHOT! Not a bad effort at all from Dier as he latches onto the end of a loose ball across the top of the box and goes for goal, with the shot just flashing past the upright. He has a grin on his face afterwards and he knows that could've been a screamer.

Ben Davies takes the weight off after slotting Spurs' second.

76: A final Newcastle change with Gayle replaced by Mikel Merino for the final 15 minutes or so. A debut for the substitute. 

74: Could that have been a third? It's a lovely ball into the path of Kane from Eriksen, but Elliot comes racing off his line to collect ahead of the striker. 


A lovely team goal from Tottenham and they have doubled their lead at St James' Park.
It goes Demeble to Kane to Eriksen all with one touch and while the Dane tries to get the ball under control, Davies latches on to poke home through the legs of Clark.
He ends up on the floor but he doesn't mind as the ball has already hit the back of the net.

69: Newcastle make a now-rare foray into the opposition half but they don't make too much from the break. Hayden attempts a lofted cross from the right but it goes out of play at the first time of asking.

67: A decent corner for Tottenham which is delivered by Eriksen. It meets the head of Alderweireld but he cannot quite get it on target as the Magpies eventually clear.


65: It has to be said, Walker-Peters has made a fine debut this afternoon and has been involved in the attacks in the second half. He does so again, trying to pick out Kane with a right wing cross but the Newcastle defence clear ahead of the striker.

"He times his run perfectly Dele Alli and on the stretch he knows if he gets a good connection he's going to score. It was a lovely ball from Eriksen. 
"It's going to be along half an hour for those Newcastle lads now you'd think, unless they can somehow come back with a reply. As the game goes on they're going to get more and more tired - mentally as well."

Alli is certainly the centre of attention today and after being invovled in Shelvey's sending off, he now scores the opening goal. 
It's a brilliant move as Kane picks out Eriksen to his right before bursting into the box but the Dane has his eyes on Alli's run at the back post, lofting a great pass into his feet as the England midfielder makes a sliding stretch to meet it and poke home past Elliot.
As you can imagine, the St James' Park faithful are not amused with the goal or the scorer but Spurs are off the mark in the 2017/18 Premier League season.

60: That could have been a dangerous rebound for Newcastle as Walker-Peters fires in a cross from the right flank, looking for Kane but he is flanked by two defenders.
The ball ricochets off Kane and Mbemba before flashing just wide of the upright. 

58: Eliott is now down on the field after a challenge with Sissoko, but after a few moments, he gets back to his feet.
There are almighty boos around St James' Park as Sissoko is the subbed, with Heung-Min Son on in his place.

Jonjo Shelvey not really entitled to his "Who, me?" look of disbelief here. A more blatant red card, you will not see.

56: Spurs are looking to make their extra man count now as they put continued pressure on the Newcastle box. 
A worrying moment for the Magpies as Perez goes down with a knock but he looks OK to continue.

53: SAVE! Kane nearly breaks the deadlock as he hits a half volley right at the mouth of the goal but Elliot again makes a superb save to keep Spurs out. 
After the passage of play, Ritchie then goes into the book for an earlier foul on Alli. It's getting a bit tasty out there now.

"That has come as a shock to everyone in the stadium. It certainly has to me. Dele Alli thinks Shelvey's stepped on his ankle intentionally from his reaction. 
"Is that the most stupid red card you've ever seen in your life? Right under the referee's nose as well."

51: But almost instantly after, Newcastle nearly take the lead as Gayle shoots from close range on the left, but Lloris is level to it to push it away.

48: RED CARD SHELVEY! Just ridiculous from Shelvey. Alli is on the floor after a clash with Ritchie. As everyone is getting back into place for a Spurs free kick, Shelvey comes into the equation to try and get the ball from Alli, standing on his ankle in the process. You can't really miss an ankle that close up.
Was it deliberate or not? He will probably say no but Andre Marriner produces the red card for the foul. St James' Park is stunned but Newcastle are down to ten men.

47: Good defending from Shelvey there as Spurs speed down the left flank and Davies whipping in a fine cross. It looks to be heading for the feet of Kane but the Newcastle man in there to clear.

46: Here we go them, the second half is underway. Goals galore please lads!

"Tottenham lack energy for me today; Newcastle are looking pretty comfortable so far. "


A relatively quiet Premier League return for Newcastle so far with no real chances to speak of for the home side. Tottenham have not fared much better, with Christian Eriksen trying his luck with a few long range efforts but Rob Elliot has collected them all with ease.
The game needs a firework in the second half to jolt it into life. 

45+2: Free kick to Spurs as Alli is fouled by Clar. Eriksen tries to lift it into the box but a Newcastle shirt is there to clear at the first time of asking. 
The Magpies then break and St James' Park erupts into noise, but Gayle's cross is collected by Lloris.

Florian Lejeune's Premier League bow was all over in a flash after Harry Kane's scissor challenge scythed him to the ground. 

45: Another long range Eriksen shot and another save from Elliot. Arguably Eriksen should have played it in for one of the players around him but you cannot blame the guy for having a pop.
Three minutes added on after injuries to Dummett and Lejeune in the first half.

43: What a tackle from Dembele! Atsu is at it again down the left flank and easily nips past Walker-Peters but Dembele is waiting for him and makes a superb table to stop him in his tracks. No free kick either as he cleanly gets the ball. 
Good work from the Spurs man because Atsu is dangerous when he gets into his stride.

41: SAVE! Eriksen is the only one producing any kind of chances for Spurs in the first half and he does so again, letting fly from the top of the box but Elliot reads his effort well and makes a strong stop.

"They're doing alright, Newcastle. They've restricted Tottenham to one or two chances. 
"I'm a bit disappointed with Spurs and the tempo of their play. It could have been a bit quicker.
"It's difficult to judge Spurs and Pochettino until that transfer window closes. In an ideal world he'll have wanted it all concluded before today but it's not always possible." 


All over at Selhurst Park! A massive win for Crystal Palace, inspired by the returning Wilfried Zaha. 
Roy Hodgson has his first win, Palace have their first points of the season and their first goals, while it's misery for Chelsea. They were poor today.

90+5: David Luiz takes a heavy touch in midfield and Milivojevic boots the ball into Row Z. A huge roar from the Selhurst Park crowd. That's nearly that.

90+3: Palace are playing this stoppage time superbly. They are penning the ball back deep inside Chelsea's half - Conte's side can't get out.

90+1: CHANCE! What is Sakho playing at?! He tries a back-heel IN HIS OWN BOX and it drops to Fabregas but the Chelsea midfielder snatches at his shot and it goes wide. A massive let-off for Palace and Dann has a word with Sakho. Probably along the lines of, 'Don't try that again please'.

90: FIVE minutes of added time. Groans go around Selhurst Park, they don't like that.

90: CHANCE! Townsend twists and turns down the right, beating Azpilicueta and getting his shot away but it flies a few yards wide of the far post.
Chelsea look like they've run out of ideas. Still time, though.

88: YELLOW! Bakayoko hauls down Townsend - the winger has been superb along with Zaha - and the Chelsea man is booked.

87: WHAT A MISS! Van Aanholt should seal it for Palace after Courtois spills Townsend's long-range shot but the Dutchman fires wide from close range.
Will that come back to haunt Palace? Just over four minutes plus stoppage time to go.

85: Selhurst Park is absolutely bouncing as the finish line approaches.
SUBS! Hodgson makes two changes as Timothy Fosu-Mensah replaces James McArthur and Jairo Riedewald comes on for Yohan Cabaye.
Two midfielders withdrawn for two defenders.

83: YELLOW! Dann takes the booking to bring Pedro down and break up a Chelsea counter. A cynical challenge.

81: Zaha gets a huge round of applause from the home crowd for holding the ball up and eventually winning a free-kick midway inside the Palace half. He has been brilliant on his first league appearance since the opening day of the season.

79: Palace keep the play alive in the Chelsea half for just about the first time since the second half started but their possession comes to an end when Townsend blasts it into the stands.
They have just over 10 minutes plus stoppage time to hang on.

75: SUB! Here comes the first Palace change as Jason Puncheon comes on to replace Schlupp.

73: SAVE! Fabregas' corner picks out Alonso, who gets a firm header on goal but Speroni dives to his right to save, gathering at the second attempt.
Hodgson is preparing his first change of the game.

72: CHANCE! Musonda makes a great run off Ward and is picked out by a superb pass by Fabregas. The youngster takes the ball on his chest but slices his volley over the bar. A big opportunity.

72: YELLOW! Milivojevic chops down Hazard to halt a Chelsea counter and that's an easy booking for referee Andre Marriner.

71: A rare chance for Palace to break sees Zaha waste the opportunity. The forward takes a heavy touch and David Luiz nips in to send the ball back to Courtois. A few tired legs out there for the home side.

68: SAVES! Speroni gets down to stop Pedro's low shot from the edge of the box - and he then does the same to deny Zappacosta. Palace are sinking further back towards their own goal.


66: SUB! Musonda voiced his frustration at his lack of opportunities at Chelsea earlier this week, taking to social media to do so. Well, he has his chance now. He has just replaced Willian.

64: Palace are giving Fabregas time in midfield and it's asking for trouble. 
The assistant's flag has denied Chelsea twice in the last few minutes - first Zappacosta and then Pedro - with Fabregas spraying passes out from midfield on each occasion.

62: A little scare for Palace as Alonso flashes a near-post header into the side netting.
Chelsea are starting to turn up the pressure.

61: Zappacosta is just starting to get a little more joy down Chelsea's right but every cross is being dealt with by Palace - and Sakho in particular. He'll need another massive 30 minutes to keep Palace in front.

57: SUB! An interesting change from Antonio Conte. Batshuayi is not happy to see his number go up and he's replaced by Pedro.

55: CLOSE! Zaha is playing brilliantly! He skips away from a couple of challenges and feeds Townsend on the right. The winger looks to return the favour and find his team-mate in the middle but Azpilicueta just about does enough to stop Zaha from turning on goal.
How Palace have missed him over these past two months.

52: CHANCE! Another opportunity for Fabregas as Zappacosta's cross breaks to him on the edge of the area but this time the Spaniard blazes well over the bar.

50: CROSSBAR! Fabregas is so unlucky! He went close in the first half and clips the bar here with a fine drive from 25 yards. Speroni was nowhere near it.

48: Palace have made a composed start to the second period, they are passing the ball around nicely against a very good Chelsea team. It's been very impressive especially considering their plight at the bottom of the table.

46: We are back under way for the second half - you feel it's a huge 45 minutes for Palace.



Hodgson will be very pleased with that. The half-time whistle goes and Zaha - returning from two months out injured - has Palace in front after Bakayoko cancelled out Azpilicueta's own goal.


A huge goal for Palace on the stroke of half-time!
It's good work from Sakho, who robs Willian and finds Zaha on the left. The winger's first touch completely takes Azpilicueta out of the game and Zaha keeps his composure to slide his finish by Courtois.
A really good goal from the Palace star.

42: CLOSE! Fabregas goes so so so close! The Spaniard blasts a free kick from 22 yards and it grazes the top of the crossbar. Speroni was nowhere near it.

40: SUB! Chelsea finally make the change as Davide Zappacosta replaces the injured Moses.

39: CLOSE! Chelsea are playing on with 10 men after Moses hobbles off and Townsend goes very close to making it 2-1. He picks up possession 25 yards from goal and flashes a great effort inches wide.

37: Moses is down for Chelsea having pulled up on the right. It doesn't look good for the right-back, who is just returning to the team.
The replay shows that could be a hamstring problem. Oh dear.

34: The game has just calmed down after a lively start. You fancy Chelsea to push on now, after weathering that early Palace storm.
CHANCE! Willian smartly lets a Moses cross run to Alonso and his effort is well blocked by Ward. Palace are then nearly undone by another corner but Batshuayi nods over from seven yards.

31: It turns out that early Palace goal has been taken off Cabaye and given to Azpilicueta as an own goal. Guess the wait for a Palace goalscorer goes on.

29: . but it was short-lived.

28: Early joy for Palace.


24: Townsend briefly has the home crowd worried as he pulls up off the ball but it looks like it was just a knock. He is running freely again now. He has made a good start to the game and considering the injuries they have, they need him.

22: CHANCE! Better from Palace as Zaha skips away from two defenders and fires on goal from the right. His effort takes a deflection off Cahill and whistles past the far post. The resulting corner is cleared.
This game has been excellent so far, end to end stuff.

21: Hodgson will not be happy with his team's marking from that corner. They have been excellent in the opening stages but a lapse in concentration at a set-piece has let them down.

Chelsea equalise and all Palace's good work is undone. It is poor defending too as Hodgson's men fail to pick up Bakayoko from a corner and the Chelsea midfielder nods downward and past Speroni.
A good finish from the former Monaco man, he is very dangerous in the air as Man City found out in the Champions League last season.

17: Chelsea have responded since the goal and enjoy their best spell of possession in the Palace half before Azpilicueta delivers a good ball into the middle but Batshuayi is on his heels.



FT: Three wins on the spin for Conte's men. They limped over the line here but they look in ruthless mood. Morata and the returning Kante did the job with a goal either side of the break. Vardy scored from the spot but it wasn't enough. Stay tuned for highlights. 

90+1: CHANCE!! Mahrez whips in a ball to the near post and Vardy springs to try and flick an effort towards goal.. he can't get any purchase on it. That could be the last chance. 

90: CHANCE!! Mahrez gives the ball away and Chelsea break. They work it Willian who flies into the area. He just has Schmeichel to beat but the goalkeeper stands tall. Great save. 

88: More huffing and puffing from Leicester but a real lack of quality. Kante is doing a fine job in front of the back five. He's been at his destructive best today. 

85: CLOSE!! Willian steps inside from the left and opens up his body. He curls a fantastic effort towards the far corner but it whistles inches past the post. 

82: PENALTY APPEAL NOT GIVEN! Hazard gets down the left and finds Alonso. His cross finds Morata about eight yards out. His header is blocked by the outstretched arm of Magure. Looked a very good shout. Ref says no.

80: CLOSE!! Zappacosta! Nearly a dream debut. He's in acres of space down the right flank. He reverses an effort towards the far post but it sails a couple of yards wide.

77: SUB! Iheanacho replaces James. It's his home debut. Here comes Hazard, too. He's on for Fabregas. His first appearance of the season. 

75: Mahrez tries to take on three defenders down the right flank. But gets crowded out. Good defending. 

73: SUB! Zappacosta is on for his Chelsea debut. Moses, who took a knock on his ribs, is replaced.

72: Leicester getting a little aggy with the referee here. Rudiger goes to clear and Vardy comes across to make the block. Rudiger actually kicks Vardy but Chelsea get the foul. Vardy is incensed. 

70: Break in play as James and Moses bang into each other just outside the Leicester area. Moses comes off slightly worse with a bang in the ribs. 

68: CHANCE!! Luiz comes forward with the ball and follows his pass. He gets the return back from Morata and a chance on the volley drops to him about 18 yards out. He swings a right boot at it but it sails over the crossbar. 

66: PENALTY APPEAL!! Moses flies into the area down the right and Gray tracks him but falls over. The ball hits his arm whilst on the ground.. nothing given from the referee. Conte has a moan at the fourth official. 

64: SUB! Conte is trying to calm his troops down. He sends on Willian for Pedro. 

On his 200th league appearance, Vardy steps up and powers an effort down the middle. Courtois dived out of the way. Game on!

61: PENALTY TO LEICESTER!! VARDY FOULED BY COURTOIS! The ball breaks loose in the area and Courtois doesn't see Vardy coming from behind him. The striker beats the goalkeeper to the ball and is clipped. 

60: Gray tries to get his team going down the left wing. He wins a throw. Fuchs launches a long throw into the mixer which causes Courtois to come off his line. and he gets enough on the punch to clear his lines. 


58: CHANCE! Fabregas plays a clever one-two with Pedro down the right flank and gets into the box. Where are the Leicester midfield? The Spaniard tries his luck from the angle but skews his effort well wide.

56: Pedro shows Fuchs a clean pair of heels down the right wing. He gets to the by-line but his cut-back for Morata is cut out by Maguire. 

53: SHOT! Leicester need to be careful here. Chelsea could run riot. Alonso finds space down the left and hits a daisy cutter across the face which flies wide. 

Would you believe it? The returning hero has banged one home to put Chelsea firmly in control. There doesn't look much on from 30 yards as Kante moves into space. He hits a speculative low effort which skids off the surface and sneaks into the bottom corner. There is no celebration from the little man. 

48: Vardy makes a great run down the left and forces a corner. The big boys come up but the delivery is cleared away by Luiz. 

45: We are back. Leicester making a double change. Albrighton and Slimani are being withdraw. King and Gray replaces them. The hosts get the game back underway. 


HT: Cracking game, this. Chances at either end but it's Morata that has made the difference. That came about a minute after Slimani was denied by Courtois after a fantastic break. All to play for still in this one. See you in 15.

45: SAVE!! Moses bangs a first-time effort from 22 yards which swerves in the air. Schmeichel watches it carefully and pushes it clear.

43: SCRAMBLE! Good response by Leicester. They force a corner and Chelsea fail to clear. It drops to James about 18 yards out but his effort is blocked inadvertently by Maguire, who was on the deck. 

After survivingat one end, Chelsea strike at the other. This is all about Azpilicueta. He moves forward and swings a tasty ball into the mixer. Morata is on the move and meets it with a fantastic header. Bang. Straight into the net. 

39: WHAT A BREAK! Classic Leicester. They nick the ball up one end and break like lightning. It's a two-on-one with Mahrez and Vardy. The winger uses his mate as a decoy and reverses a great ball into Slimani. His effort is saved by Courtois.  


36: TACKLE! Yes, it's him again. Morata breezes in behind again but takes too long with his finish. Morgan gets back to make the clearance. Morgan 0-0 Chelsea. 

34: BLOCK!! Kante robs possession deep in Leicester territory and releases Morata down the left-edge of the box. He gets the ball out of his feet and hits a half-volley, which is travelling. Morgan is there with a brave block. Super defending. 

31: Vardy charges into a fair tackle with Alonso by the touchline. He clearly gets the ball but the defender hits the deck. No foul is given and rightly so. Alonso make a miracle recovery when he sees that the referee doesn't buy it. 


28: Pedro tries to back Simpson into the area but the defender defends well to usher the wide-man away from danger. 

25: CHANCE!! Mahrez and Vardy link up. the striker should do better. Typical run from the striker in behind and Mahrez finds him. He's about 18 yards out but he snatches at the effort. Well wide. 

23: CHANCE! Super play from Morata. He releases Moses in behind down the right. He digs a low cross out from the by-line and Morgan has to be alert AGAIN to divert it away from danger. 

21: FREE-KICK! Morata wins a free-kick about 35 yards out. Only one man lining this one up, Luiz. He fires one in after his traditional run-up but it bobbles straight to Schmeichel. 

19: COUNTER! Mahrez bursts into the game off the right wing. He plays a neat one-two with Slimani on the edge of the box but takes one touch too many as Chelsea crowd him out. 

17: Moses sprints away down the right flank and has plenty of support. Morgan gets a decisive boot in the way to clear. Couple of important clearances so far from the skipper.

15: Odd to see Danny Drinkwater not with his Leicester pals today. He'll be looking to get on the pitch at some point for the champions.

CONFIRMED: That all-important Golden Goal has been scored in the 6th minute - Danny Welbeck with the effort for Arsenal against Bournemouth.

14: Chelsea dominating the ball. Leicester are back in their shape and dealing with it, but Fabregas especially looks very threatening. Morata always looking for the ball in behind. 

11: CHANCE!! Vintage Fabregas. He pings a sensational ball over the top for Morata who beats the offside trap. He tries to take the shot first-time over his shoulder but completely misses his kick. He was only 10 yards out. 

10: CLOSE!! Brilliant wide play from Chelsea. Moses flashes a low centre into the middle which comes all the way through to Alonso at the back post. He fires it back across goal and Morgan does well to turn the ball away for a corner inside his six yard box. 

8: Leicester keeping the pressure on. Mahrez swings a ball into the danger area which drops to Maguire on the left. He can't quite get the ball back into the box and the chance is lost. 

5: Good response by Leicester. Vardy and Mahrez looking sharp in wide areas. The England man flashes a cross into the six yard box but Slimani was caught on his toes. 

3: SHOT! Positive start by Chelsea. Bakayoko powers through the middle and shifts it out to Morata. He tries his luck from 22 yards Schmeichel makes a comfortable save.


FT: Full time at the John Smith's and it has ended up 1-1.
Depoitre had given the hosts the lead but Vardy cancelled it out from the penalty spot.
Huddersfield will feel they deserved all three points as Kachunga saw a perfectly good goal ruled out for offside.

90: Brilliant anticipation as he races from his line to head away a Mooy pass that was looping towards Van La Parra. And here come Leicester at the other end but Slimani lashes the ball high and wide.

90: A third and final change is coming up for Huddersfield with Van La Parra on in place of the goalscorer Depoitre.

89: A penalty appeal for Leicester but Moss waves it away! Gray had raced through on goal and cut across Zanka before hitting the deck! It looked like a dive and thankfully for the hosts it wasn't given.

85: The home fans are calling for Okazaki to be sent off as he fouls Hogg just minutes after earning a caution for hauling Williams to the deck. However, Moss waves away the protests.

84: Mooy has been excellent today and he races onto a ball down the left before sending a cross into the box and Quaner beats Chilwell to the ball only to flick the ball hopelessly wide. What an opportunity that was for the substitute to seal the points!

81: Another change for Huddersfield with Hogg on for Sabiri. Varsy is also making way for the visitors with Slimani on in his place.

80: Mooy whips a tantalising cross into the box but Chilwell is there to hack it clear with Quaner bearing down on him at the far post.

79: Okazaki leaves the ball behind sloppily and in attempt to rectify his mistake he hauls Williams down resulting in Moss flashing the yellow card in his direction. 

77: CHANCE! Mooy feeds the ball into Ince and he bends a wicked shot agonisingly wide of the post! He very nearly got the better of his childhood pal Schmeichel who wouldn't have got there.
The pair know each other well as their father's Paul Ince and Peter Schmeichel were both at Manchester United at the same time.

74: Gray skips down the left touchline and fires a pass into the near post but Zanka stretches to clear the ball before it reaches Vardy in the middle.

72: Change for Huddersfield, Quaner is on for Kachunga, who will feel like he should've had his first Premier League goal after his effort was wrongfully ruled out.

71: Mahrez is beginning to have a big influence on this game and he evaded Lowe again to cut inside and shoot but Schindler blocks it inside his six-yard-box. It's end-to-end at the moment! 

69: What a chance for Leicester! Mahrez does brilliantly to cut onto his left foot before flashing a cross-shot towards the far post and Vardy inexplicably fails to get contact with the goal gaping! The England striker boots the post in anger after that chance went begging.
Paul Merson isn't impressed, he's labelled it one of the "biggest sitters he's ever seen" on Soccer Saturday!

68: Another change from Leicester with Okazaki on to replace Iheanacho. The former Manchester City man had a couple of bright moments but struggled to link with Vardy.

67: Following that quickfire double of goals, the game has settled down a bit with Huddersfield once again dominating possession.

65: Change for the visitors with Gray coming on in place of Albrighton.

65: Good play from Huddersfield on the edge of the box and the ball is eventually worked to Williams on the edge and the midfielder lashes a fearsome volley just wide of the goal with Schmeichel scrambling across to try and reach it. That shot was absolutely flying!

62: OFFSIDE! A controversial moment here as Kachunga turns in Zanka's shot from close range but he is wrongly deemed to be offside! Wagner will not be happy about that if it denies his side the three points.

59: Here come Huddersfield on the counter, Sabiri picks out Mooy who slides in Ince on the left wing, he lifts his head and attempts a low ball into the box but it is deflected behind for a corner.

58: Depoitre managed just a solitary league goal in his one and only season at Porto but he's already off the mark for Huddersfield in just his second league outing. He's led the line well in Mounie's absence.

PIC: Vardy's penalty levelled the scores in this one - and he was pretty happy about it.

Vardy's good form under Shakespeare continues.

55: Huddersfield will be kicking themselves at letting Leicester back into the game so soon after conceding but there is no doubt that it was a penalty. We've already had more action in ten second half minutes than we did for the whole of the first half.


52: Well it's all happening now as Zanka goes close to scoring a third goal of the half as his rasping shot is tipped over by his compatriot Schmeichel.

King was brought down by Lowe just inside the penalty area and Vardy steps up to send Lossl the wrong way and rifle the ball into the back of the net for his fourth Premier League goal of the season.

48: PENALTY for Leicester!

Well we called for more goalmouth action and we've got a goal straight after half-time thanks to Depoitre who nets on his full Premier League debut! The big Belgian latched onto a through ball from Sabiri, bullied Maguire out of the way and fired low and hard past Schmeichel!

46: Huddersfield get this second half underway. Hopefully there will be more goalmouth action this half! There was just one shot on target in the opening 45 minutes.

Iheanacho has looked the most likely to make something happen here but so far it has been a game for the defenders.
Maguire and Schindler have been the standout performers of the first half.

Leicester are the 7/4 favourites to go on and win this, with
Huddersfield 5/2 while the draw is now most likely at 11/8. Jamie Vardy is the
6/1 favourite to open the scoring despite a quiet first half, with Depoitre considered the hosts’ main
threat at 12/1.

HT: Leicester are finishing this half on top and have a throw deep in Huddersfield's half. 
Simpson finds Iheanacho and he looks to return it back into his half but it's cleared and Jon Moss sounds his whistle for half-time.
A fairly drab encounter this, truth be told, but Huddersfield have probably shaded it without creating an awful lot.

44: Corner kick to Huddersfield. Ince trots over to take it and he whips an inswinging ball into the box but Leicester defend it well again and are awarded a free-kick.

43: The game is becoming a touch scrappy now with both teams guilty of conceding possession far too easily. Ndidi is the latest culprit, lazily overhitting a simple pass over Vardy and it bobbles out for a goal kick.

41: Lossl flaps at a cross into the box and the ball bounces free in the box with Iheanacho swivelling on it and lashing a volley towards goal but Mooy is there to block.
Leicester launch another attack and Vardy is free on the left but his lobbed effort drifts harmlessly wide of Lossl's goal.

40: Mahrez stands over the free-kick with King and Maguire also interested.
It's Mahrez but his shot is well defended by the wall and the ball cannons out for a throw in.

39: Leicester are starting to look a touch more threatening as Mahrez bursts into life on the edge of the area but he fails to beat Lowe with some fancy footwork and Huddersfield clear.
The hosts have an opportunity of their own with Smith picking out Depoitre but he inexplicably dummies it to no-one.
And now Leicester are on the attack! Chilwell lays the ball into the path of Iheanacho but his run is blocked off by Schindler who is promptly awarded the first yellow card of the game.

37: Huddersfield have had plenty of the ball but they are knocking it about a little too slowly making it easy for Leicester to defend against them. Mooy, who has dictated things in the middle, slices a crossfield pass out for a throw in.

35: Mahrez puts his head in his hands as Simpson hopelessly cedes possession by shanking the ball out for a throw-in.
Mahrez hasn't quite got going yet with Leicester struggling to get out of their half.

32: A needless foul from Chilwell as he barges Depoitre to the floor just inside Leicester's half even though the ball was zooming out for a throw-in.
Jon Moss, who sent off Sadio Mane last week, keeps his cards in his pocket.

31: Smith knocks a long ball into the area but Schmeichel comes to claim it authoritatively and send his side up field.
Vardy links up with Iheanacho and he slides the ball past Zanka but Schindler is covering to clear before he can latch onto the loose ball. Another important intervention there from the towering defender.

29: Williams sends a searching pass out to Kachunga but he is beaten in the air by Chilwell. Now Leicester launch a rare attack with Vardy finding Iheanacho who backheels it into the path of Mahrez but Huddersfield's defenders get back to swarm around the Algerian and it comes to nothing.

26: The camera has panned to Shakespeare and he does not look happy, gesticulating wildly at his players to get going.
They have been very much second best so far but have at least restricted their hosts to half chances.

25: Referee Jon Moss is calling Maguire over for a word and Morgan is also there. Not sure exactly what's happened there.
Anyway Mooy for the umpteenth time sends a cross in and Maguire heads the ball out of Schmeichel's hands and back out wide.

23: Mooy steadies himself and whips another cross into the box from the right and it goes all the way through to Lowe on the opposite side, he dinks a cross back into the box but Maguire is there to head behind for a corner.
Mooy has another go with a ball into the box and Schindler attacks it but it is deflected out for yet another corner. Mooy sends it in but Vardy is back there to nod it clear.

20: Huddersfield have enjoyed 56% possession so far but they haven't really created an awful lot with Depoitre's early head their only shot on target so far.

17: Mooy hoists a hopeful left-footed cross into the box and Maguire heads it only to Ince on the edge of the area but his shot is weak and easily blocked away from danger before Morgan slashes the ball out of play for a throw in.

15: Iheanacho moves purposefully forward with the ball and into the penalty area but he sees a curled effort blocked by Zanka. That was good play from the Nigerian as he evaded the challenge from Williams but he just couldn't get his shot off quickly enough.



Again, not the longest post-match press conference I've been to as Paco Moreno makes his exit. But who can blame him? After all, he's got a victory to celebrate and a 350-mile trip back to the North East to think about, after all.

“I have spoken to Rafa. He has rang to congratulate
everyone, especially the players,” Moreno added.
The Magpies assistant as revealed the recuperating
Spaniard, who was watching from home, was in regular contact with his backroom staff
throughout the game.

“I hope I can maintain this record throughout my career,”
the stand-in manager jokes, when asked to discuss his 100 per cent record as a
manager.

Out with one, in with another as Newcastle assistant Paco Moreno answers questions the the assembled media.

Short and sweet from Clement, he clearly wasn't keen to hang around after such a disappointing defeat.

Clement refused to get drawn into the debate surrounding Matt Ritchie's high boot on Alfie Mawson.
“I don’t think it was a big deal. I’m only being asked
this question because of what happened yesterday."

“He did some good things and things not so good. There was
a lot of expectation with him which is normal. He’s a player that will get
better the more he knows his team-mates, the system and the culture of the club.
He did OK.”

“We missed an opportunity. They are a well organised side
but the team we played at home, we should have done better.”

Swansea boss Paul Clement cuts a frustrated figure in his post-match press conference.
“The difference in the two teams was much greater. They were
more combative in the duels, and they deserved the victory. From a technical
view we made too many mistakes.”

Let's hear from the Newcastle skipper alongside Matt Ritchie.

Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles has been speaking to Sky Sports.
"The manager rang me this morning and said make sure the boys
are on it and start well. 
"He was there watching and hopefully he is back soon
and can join us. I said at the start of the season we need to do well at home
and get the fans going and then we will be hard to beat, but if we play like
this we will be hard to beat every week. 
"It’s down to us, we can play good
football and beat the good teams, we need to bring it every week and today we
did."

Matt Ritchie was booked for a high foot on Mawson in a similar incident to the one that saw Sadio Mane sent off against Manchester City yesterday.
Speaking to Sky Sports, Ritchie said: "I had my eye on the ball, but I think
he came a bit lower than yesterday [Mane]. 
"I was delighted to see a yellow
card. There was no intent. I didn’t see his [Mawson] reaction. I looked straight round
to see what the referee was doing and lucky enough it was a yellow card."

Alan Pardew said: "It was good sound performance from Newcastle today, I can’t
think of one bad performance across the team.
Redknapp added: "They controlled the game for large spells and were very good
on the counter-attack. Merino was good - apart from his Tom Daley impression in the first half."

Jamaal Lascelles is the hero for Newcastle, making a crucial goal-line clearance at 0-0 before scoring the winner. A huge win for the visitors.

90+4: A late chance for Swansea, who win a free-kick down the left. But Clucas' delivery is woeful again, easily cleared at the near post.

90+2: Bony releases Narsingh into the tunnel and he draws a low save from Elliot, another Swansea corner.
This one is better by Clucas, nodded down into the six-yard box, but Elliot gathers for Newcastle.

90+2: Swansea win another corner - they haven't made the most of these today - and they waste it again. Clucas takes but badly over-hits the cross, sending it out for a goal kick.

90: FIVE minutes of added time.

88: Swansea win a corner and it's a free header for Fer 10 yards out but the midfielder sends it over the bar. Nothing is going Swansea's way at the moment.

87: YELLOW! Gayle goes into the book for trying to delay a Swansea free-kick. The striker thought Fer had handballed before the whistle and he had a point. No changing the referee's mind, though.

86: We have a stoppage in play now as Merino has taken the ball to the midriff. He's winded and the physio is on.
SUB! Swansea use the time to make a change as Tom Carroll is replaced by Luciano Narsingh.

82: Perez is a little lucky to escape a booking as he mistimes a tackle on Fer in midfield. Swansea are in a hurry to get on with it.

80: YELLOW! Fer crunches in on Atsu and that's a nasty challenge. A clear booking.

“Hush falls around the Liberty Stadium as it hits home
that there are 13 minutes for the Swans to get something from the game. It's of stark contrast to the away end where the Newcastle supporters are jubilant after
seeing their side take the lead. Has there ever been a game where Newcastle supporters
don’t take off their shirts?”

79: SUB! Dwight Gayle replaces Joselu.

He was the saviour at one end for Newcastle and it looks like Lascelles might have popped up with the winner!
He rises highest to power a header home from Ritchie's corner. Nothing Fabianski could do there.

74: SAVE! Slightly more routine for Fabianski as he gathers Joselu's header from Gamez's clipped cross. It's been better from Newcastle over the last five minutes.

73: CHANCE! Perez tests Fabianski with a low drive but the Swansea goalkeeper is equal to it, saving with his legs. This game could go either way now.

70: SUB! Newcastle respond with their own change as Mo Diame replaces Isaac Hayden.

69: SUB! Renato Sanches' largely ineffective debut is over, replaced by Wilfried Bony.
So Paul Clement is going for it, Bony partnering Abraham up front.

68: CHANCE! Almost out of nothing for the visitors! Ritchie pokes into the path of Perez and his cross-shot drags across the six-yard box. Atsu was on his heels.


67: Swansea are on top now as we approach the final quarter of the game. It would not be a surprise to see Newcastle make a change too.

“Try as he might, Renato Sanches cannot get into this
game. He’s drifted into a central role having spent the majority of the first
half on the right, but it is yet to have the desired effect as his touch and awareness let's him down at the vital moment. It would seem the youngster will need some
time adjusting to the Premier League."

65: It looks like we could be about to see Bony and the crowd are going 'Wild, wild, wild'.

62: That really was brilliant defending by Lascelles, denying Abraham a certain goal. The Swansea striker needed to put a bit more on his finish after rounding Elliot.

60: OFF THE LINE! Superb defending by Lascelles! Fer finds the run of Abraham with a great ball, the striker rounds the goalkeeper but Lascelles is there on the slide to clear with the goal gaping.

59: SUB! First Newcastle change as Christian Atsu replaces Jacob Murphy.

57: Sanches goes down softly but Swansea have a free-kick in a good position, central and about 30 yards out. The Portugal international takes it himself but blazes well over. It's not been his day so far.

56: CHANCE! Ayew dances free down the left and clips a cross to the far post where Naughton volleys back into the danger area. Clark is alert to it and clears before Abraham or Carroll can react.
56: SAVE! Ayew again the creator as he helps the ball into the path of Carroll and Elliot stands tall to keep out the midfielder's shot. A fine save.

52: Newcastle have dealt with set-plays very well and they do so again here, clearing Olsson's corner.

51: Good defending by Gamez to head clear Olsson's dangerous cross. A Swansea corner.

49: YELLOW! Ritchie goes in with a high foot on Mawson and it's a booking. That's a very similar challenge to the one that earned a red card for Sadio Mane at Manchester City.

48: YELLOW! Naughton slips as Gamez breaks forward and the Swansea defender makes a desperate lunge to trip his opponent. A booking all day long. 

46: We are back under way for the second half.

In the Sky Sports studio, Jamie Redknapp said: “Joselu has played really well, he’s the reason Newcastle
have got into this game by holding the ball up.
“But I have been disappointed with Swansea.”
On Merino's penalty appeal, Redknapp added: “It’s an incredible
dive. I thought penalty all day long at first but that’s poor from Merino.”


All square at the break with the goalkeepers on top. One particularly stunning save from Fabianski has the score level. Joselu had thought he'd scored.


And that concludes our coverage from the John Smith’s
Stadium, where Harry Kane continued his sensational form in front of goal as
Spurs moved up to third. Be sure to key across the Sky Sports platforms for more reaction, and the rest of
Saturday's Premier League games, which have just got underway.

It proved to be a tough afternoon for Huddersfield
manager David Wagner, who had no
choice but to praise Tottenham's quality after their 4-0 win over his side.

Mauricio Pochettino says he is proud of everyone at the club for getting a good result against Huddersfield after their midweek game in the Champions League.

“I’m comfortable putting Kane in the category of
Lewandowski and Cavani, those world-class centre-forwards. That is outstanding
for a 24-year-old.
"Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester
City and Chelsea – every one of those clubs would want him now.
“They would pay £100m-£150m for him because they know
they are going to get six, seven eight years of gold, of a player delivering
goals and professionalism. You cannot say anything higher than that, he is a
great, great player.
"But there are three characters who aren’t going anywhere in the next 18 months for Tottenham: Dele Alli, Mauricio Pochettino and Kane aren’t going anywhere. Daniel Levy wouldn’t let them go anywhere."

Jamie Redknapp was similarly complimentary of Harry Kane
after he took his September goals tally to 13 for club and country.
“He looks like a player that appreciate every single
second on the pitch. He’s had to do it the hard way at the likes of Leyton
Orient, and he wasn’t brought up on the red carpet.
“As a young player he was wasn’t the best player in the
academy, but look at the progress he has made. That has come from hard work and
dedication. He is a joy to watch.”

Asked to describe Harry Kane’s performance, Gary Neville
said: “Fantastic. Brilliant.
“He is a dream. He is a lad that will never have a bad
run. He won’t always score goals but he will contribute to the team, he’ll be a
target man and bring players in to play.
“He’ll become a leader and take on responsibility, you’ll
see a change in character in him in the next couple of years, which we have
started seeing already.
“He has got so much more to come in terms developing his
character further, on top of the fact he is an absolutely outstanding professional
and player.”

Huddersfield defender Mathias Jorgensen has offered his take after coming up against
Harry Kane and a free-flowing Spurs outfit.
“Kane is a goal scorer. If you give him half a chance he punishes
you. That’s going to be great for England and their chances of qualifying.
"We need
to make sure we play collectively, like we did in spells todays, and erase the
mistake. It sounds easier than it is to do but what we learned today was that
you get punished.”

Gary Neville believes Huddersfield paid the price for affording
Spurs too much space in the opening exchanges.
“Huddersfield pushed too high up the pitch and were a
little bit naive in that respect. The centre-backs didn’t sprint back, as seen
with the first goal, and that was a little bit unforgivable. Why wouldn’t you sprint
back? They didn’t do it and it cost them early on.”


Sky Sports co-commentator Davie Provan: "We saw the very
best of Harry Kane in the first half, his full repertoire. Most of the
adjectives have been used to describe Kane and I cannot think of anymore. He
was a joy to watch his centre-forward play."


Spurs' fourth win of the season lifts them up to third in the table, two points adrift of the Manchester clubs, while a second defeat sees Huddersfield drop to 10th.

It's all over at the John Smith's Stadium as Spurs ruthlessly give Huddersfield a lesson in Premier League football. Three goals in the first 23 minutes - two more from Harry Kane - put Spurs out of sight and, while the Terriers steadied the ship in the second period, Sissoko sealed an emphatic victory for Mauricio Pochettino's men in stoppage-time.

Moussa Sissoko's first Premier League goal for Spurs puts the icing on the cake for the visitors. The Frenchman gathers Davies' floated cross at the end of a blistering counter and his effort deflects off Schindler before trickling into the back of the net.

90: There will be THREE minutes of added time at the John Smith's Stadium.

89: Sissoko's poor pass leaves Winks exposed and the Spurs midfielder has no option but to bring Van La Parra to ground. He's fortunate not to pick up a card for what was a cynical challenge.

87: SUB! Third and final change for Spurs as Kane leave the field to applause from both sets of supporters. Son comes on for the final few minutes.

86: CHANCE! Spurs hit Huddersfield on the counter as Alli scampers clear. He slots Sissoko in down the right and he cuts inside Schindler, but his tame effort is easily gathered by Lossl.

85: Malone continues to find space down the left for Huddersfield but, this time, he fails to deliver a decent cross as he effort drifts behind.

82: SUBS! Third and final change for Huddersfield as Hogg makes way for Whitehead, while Walker-Peters replaces Trippier for Spurs.

80: Alli scoops the ball up to Kane and he tries to hold off Jorgensen to get through on goal, but the Terriers centre-back wins the physical battle before heading the ball back to Lossl.

78: Sissoko shows a great turn of pace to skip away from two Huddersfield defender on the right, but his final ball is found wanting as the hosts easily clear.

75: SUB! Spurs make their first change as Sissoko replaces Eriksen for his 150th Premier League appearance.

74: Spurs go in search of a fourth as Dier reacts quickest after a corner is half clear, swiveling to get away from two Huddersfield players before his shot deflects behind for another corner.

71: Lossl almost has a moment to forget as he gathers a high ball but, under pressure from Eriksen and with the touchline bearing down on him, drops the ball. Eriksen gathers and tries to pick out Alli, but the Huddersfield stopper recovers and intercepts the cross. 

70: CHANCE! Malone gets himself to the byline and cuts a fine ball back into the six-yard box, but Kachunga can't stretch high enough to get his head on the ball.

Despite being in control, Mauricio Pochettino is screaming at his Spurs players to step it up a gear.
Davie Provan on Sky Sports: "It certainly looks as though Spurs have taken their foot off the gas here, understandably."

67: SAVE! Eriksen loses Jorgensen and Hogg, cutting in off the left flank on to his right foot, but his effort is comfortably saved by Lossl.

65: YELLOW! Kachunga picks up Huddersfield's first booking for catching Vertonghen with a late challenge as he cleared up field.

64: Malone gets in behind Trippier and cross low into the Spurs area but it's too close to Lloris, who gathers before releasing Spurs on the counter.

61: SUBS! Double change for Huddersfield as Mooy and Lowe make way for Malone and Billing - David Wagner keen to give those players on the fringe of the first-team some game time.

Live Huddersfield v Tottenham Price Boosts.

"He did brilliantly to get himself goal-side of the defender, but there's no need for that."

58: YELLOW! Alli picks Schindler's pocket to get himself goal-side but throws himself to ground as Lossl comes off his line to meet him. Referee Neil Swarbrick with every right to brandish a card.

56: Trippier has been given the all clear and is straight back into the action, racing down the right touchline, but Huddersfield do well to prevent him from reaching the ball as it travels behind for a goal kick.

"This is probably a wake-up call for Huddersfield. I think they know what awaits them at the top of the table, but if they beat the teams around them near the bottle of the table, they'll be OK."

53: Trippier goes to ground and requires treatment after coming off second best following an aerial duel with Ince.

50: CLOSE! Dier meets the corner at the near post, flicking it towards Kane at the back post, but it flashes past Kane in an instant as Huddersfield survive.

49: CHANCE! Davies threads Eriksen in behind the Huddersfield defence and he cuts the ball back for Kane, who sees his effort blocked before the ball is deflected out for a corner.

48: Trippier floats a ball up to Kane in the area but Lowe does well to usher the Spurs frontman and the ball out for a goal kick.

KICK-OFF! Both teams are as they were before the break and Huddersfield get the second half underway!

"Harry Kane is an unbelievable player, he is absolutely outstanding. He is a brilliant player and been at a completely different level so far."

"Tottenham have been absolutely brilliant, they've been the best team in the Premier League over the past two seasons in terms of amassing points and Huddersfield haven't treated them that way."




Gary Neville has offered his verdict on Huddersfield's first-half display.
"It’s been a big reality check for Huddersfield in terms
of quality. They’ve been naïve leaving themselves open to the counter-attack. You
cannot do that in any level of football, let alone the Premier League and against
Tottenham. Huddersfield have tried to take on Tottenham punch-for-punch but they are not as good as Tottenham."

What a first half that was for Tottenham! Harry Kane with a double to take his tally this month to a staggering 13 goals, either side of Ben Davies' second goal of the season. Things started so positively for Huddersfield but they simply haven't been able to cope with the pace and precision of this devastating Spurs attack, and they've got a task on their hands keeping the score respectable after the break.

45: There will be ONE minute of added time at the John Smith's.

43: OFF THE BAR! Huddersfield so unlucky not to get on the scoresheet as Laurent Depoitre tries his luck from 25 yards and sends a fierce effort cannoning off the crossbar.

42: The commentators curse strikes as Spurs win a corner immediately after my last post, but Huddersfield survive after a goal-mouth scramble.

That's it for another Super Sunday. It's been another good day for Manchester United, who beat Everton 4-0 to move level with Man City at the top of the Premier League. Thanks for your company and see you again soon!

Everton's Morgan Schneiderlin admits that the Toffees were always in the game at 1-0 down but simply didn't put their chances away to make Manchester Utd pay.

"They didn't have much but they had a couple of
chances. There is always risk when they have players like they have. I remember
for example Swansea last season, one direct free-kick in the last minutes of
the game and 1-1. It's the same [player] Sigurdsson. It's not just him it's lots
of very good players. I'm pretty sure that they're going to be fine, they're
just living a difficult moment but honestly I think the fixtures they got I
wouldn't like these fixtures for me all together at the same time. I would like
to play against one of the top five in this period but to play against all of
them like they {Everton] are doing I think is not fair for them. They are
playing against all the top teams."

"I think the performance was very good especially in
the first 30 - 35 minutes it probably was our best performance because we
played with our central defenders inside of their half, we pressed them totally
and they had no chance to come out. They only had one shot on target. I think
the first half an hour, thirty five minutes was really impressive. 
"After that Everton, good players, they came into the game. A
little bit of pressure because of the bad results but they came with pride and
with quality and they started giving us some little difficulties. But we have a
very good bench. I looked behind and I see option and possible decisions. I
made a decision to bring Ander into the game and we stayed more solid from that
moment."

It's been a tricky start to the season for Ronald Koeman and Everton.

Everton boss Ronald Koeman felt that his side played better than the scoreline suggested as the Toffees conceded three late goals to lose 4-0 to Man Utd.

Manchester United made it a frustrating homecoming for Wayne
Rooney as they thrashed Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford on Super Sunday.
United's all-time leading scorer watched his former
team-mates take an early lead thanks to a fantastic strike from Antonio
Valencia with just four minutes on the clock before late goals from Henrikh
Mkhitaryan, Romelu Lukaku, who was scoring against his former club, and Anthony
Martial put further gloss on the victory.
Despite chances at either end, including a good one for
Rooney, Everton couldn't live up to United's ruthlessness, as the hosts moved
level on points at the top of the table with rivals Manchester City.
The result leaves Everton with just four points after their
first five Premier League games, although their tricky fixture list, which has
seen them take on United, City, Chelsea and Tottenham, is behind them now.

Jose Mourinho admits he was relieved to see Henrikh Mkhitaryan score Man Utd's second goal as he felt Everton were close to equalising late on in the match.

Everton: Pickford (5), Keane (6), Jagielka (6), Williams (6), Martina (6), Schneiderlin (7), Davies (6), Gueye (7), Baines (6), Sigurdsson (7), Rooney (7).
Subs: Sandro (6), Calvert-Lewin (6), Mirallas (6)

Manchester United: De Gea (8), Valencia (8), Bailly (7), Jones (7), Young (7), Matic (7), Fellaini (6), Mata (7), Mkhitaryan (7), Rashford (5), Lukaku (7)Subs: Martial (7), Herrera (6), Lingard (6)



"The performance was very good, especially in the first 35
minutes. It was probably our best performance."

Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku cupped his ears to the Everton fans after scoring but claimed it was just banter his side won 4-0.



Antonio Valencia, who scored a stunning opener for United, has been named man of the match.

Lukaku gestured to the Everton fans after his goal, here's his take on the incident.
"It was just a bit of banter. With the free-kick I missed
they booed me but I got the rebound. It’s just football."

Romelu Lukaku is speaking to Geoff Shreeves.
"We could have scored more in the first-half. We were not
clinical enough. In the second-half Everton had more control but in the end our
quality showed."


And now for the bottom half.

Here's how the top half of the Premier League table looks after United's win.


FT: It's all over, United have another 4-0 win. They move level at the top of the Premier League table with Man City. The two sides cannot be split on points or goal difference so Pep Guardiola's side sit top because of alphabetical order. 

The Frenchman makes no mistake from the spot to put the exclamation mark on United's win.

PENALTY TO MAN UTD FOR HANDBALL!!! Martial bursts into the area but before he has a chance to get a shot away there's a handball in the penalty area. The referee points to the spot.

United have a third and it's Lukaku against his former employers. And there's a full on celebration from the Belgium international. His intial free-kick bounces off the wall and falls for Matic. The midfielder's shot is deflected before Lingard flicks the ball on for Lukaku, who makes no mistake from close range.

86: SUB! Martial replaces Mkhitaryan for the hosts.

Game, set and match to United. Williams' dreadful pass is blocked by Fellaini and the ball falls kindly for Lukaku. The Belgian lays the ball off to Mkhitaryan, who makes no mistake, burying the ball beyond Pickford.

82: YELLOW! Moments before the substitution, Bailly was booked for hacking down Calvert-Lewin.

81: SUB! Mirallas comes on for Rooney, who receives a brilliant ovation from Old Trafford.

78: Lingard gets a shot away, which is easily saved by Pickford. However, United want a penalty as it looks like Williams catches the forward but the referee waves play on.

76: SUBS! Gueye is replaced by Calvert-Lewin for the visitors, while Herrera replaces Mata. 

74: BLOCK! Sandro Ramirez has a shot blocked right on the edge of the penalty area before United spring an attack of their own. Lingard gets a shot away, but the ball is deflected behind for a corner.

71: FREE-KICK! Mkhitaryan's cross is headed clear by Williams.


70: CHANCE! Better from United as Young drives to the byline. He pulls the ball back for Lingard, who skies his effort high over the crossbar from six yards.

"There are a few groans from the home fans here. It's as if they are waiting for Everton to score."

66: SUB! Tom Davies is replaced by Sandro Ramirez for the visitors.

65: POST! Form the resultant free-kick, Mata's shot comes back off the post. The ball hits Jagielka but rebounds out for a corner. 

64: YELLOW! Williams is shown a yellow card for the challenge. 

63: CHANCE! Pickford's clearance goes straight to Mata. The Spaniard drives towards the penalty area before being brought down by Williams right on the edge. 

62: Another Everton chance. Sigurdsson pokes the ball goalwards but again De Gea makes a smart save. 

61: SUB! Rashford is replaced by Lingard. 

60: Rooney plays a lovely diagonal pass to pick out Martina. Young recovers well though to win a throw in for his side. 

57: Sigurdsson wins the ball back high up the field and picks out Rooney. However, the flag is up after Rooney strayed offside.

54: CHANCE! Mata's cross picks out Lukaku, but the Belgian cannot bring the ball down with his his chest. Instead it bounces up and he cannot get a shot away, allowing Everton to clear.



52: WIDE! Rashford drives into the penalty area before opening his body and bending a right-footed shot wide of the far post.

50: Davies slips the ball through Rooney, who looks to beat Bailly. Eventually the former United striker is crowded out as the hosts win the ball back.


The whistle blows and that's it from the Liberty Stadium!
Swansea get their first home win of the season courtesy of a Tammy Abraham double. Positive signs for Paul Clement and co; the slide continues for Huddersfield.
Full report, reaction and highlights to come.

90+3: Maybe Huddersfield will try and launch an attack here! They are patient in the build-up and Swansea look resolute, but who knows?!

90: The referee's fourth official raises his board and shows FIVE minutes of added time. Not the figure Swansea would have wanted, but Huddersfield don't look like they'll get themselves back into the game, really.

87: Paul Clement cuts a serious figure on the touchline, but you just know that inside he'll be elated. A first home league win of the season is just minutes away.

85: Aaron Mooy falls under the challenge of Ayew. He's bound to be tired after being on international duty in Sydney this week.

83: OFF THE BAR! van La Parra hits a shot that's deflected by Naughton onto the bar and over! He takes the corner but it's very tame. It's been disappointing from Wagner's men.
84: SUB: Swansea's Leon Britton makes his way off the pitch, with former Hull man Sam Clucas on his his place.

81: van La Parra hits a shot from nowhere, but Alfie Mawson's legs take the brunt. Meanwhile Huddersfield switch it up and Chris Lowe makes his way on in place of Malone.

79: CHANCE! Jordan Ayew drops the ball off to Ki, who drops the shoulder, changes direction and hits a left-footed shot just past Lossl's far post. That would've been some way to announce his return!

76: SUB! There's a huge ovation for Nathan Dyer who makes his long-awaited comeback from an Achilles injury sustained in February. He replaces Narsingh for the final stages. 

75: CLOSE! Great work from Tom Ince to free up van La Parra, but his cross is far too close to Fabianski to cause any damage.

73: Leroy Fer jogs to the bench as he's replaced by Ki Sung-yeung.

72: Clement readying a couple of changes here based on the activity on the touchline. Ki Sung-yeung is coming on by the looks of it.

70: Ayew backs Tommy Smith into a corner, but the Terriers' captain lumps away.
CLOSE! In the aftermath, Narsingh finds space on the left and crosses for Abraham. That should be his hat-trick, but Zanka sticks in a big foot to clear.

67: YELLOW! Narsingh gets past van La Parra, but the latter pulls him back in frustration and gets his name taken by Paul Tierney.

66: The Swansea front line are trying to force Lossl into another mistake at every opportunity.


64: Abraham concedes a free-kick with a clumsy challenge on van La Parra. Mooy stands over the ball 30 yards out on the left flank, but falls short of any of his team mates. Wasted.

62: van La Parra hits a weak shot with better options around him but Fabianski brings the ball under his control. It's getting slightly worrying for the Terriers, who have only scored one goal since 20 August.

60: And here comes the one change, Danny Williams returns from injury to replace Billing.

58: David Wagner looks like he's going to make a double change for the final half hour at the Liberty Stadium.
Meanwhile, Billing is about to be stretchered off by the on-site medical team here, and he leaves the pitch to a warm reception.

57: Danish U21 Philip Billing is down clutching his ankle here. But there's no foul, he's twisted the wrong way and seems to be in some pain.

55: Clement's men are looking comfortable now, they've got that two-goal advantage and know they can threaten Huddersfield with set pieces and here comes another corner. nothing.


52: Another Swansea corner from Tom Carroll threatens, but is cleared by the Terriers and the visitors have a throw.

Swansea advance and Mooy does extremely well to track back and take the ball from under Luciano Narsingh - unfortunately for him, it's straight to Jordan Ayew.
Ayew dinks over Lossl, and there's Tammy Abraham to poke it over the line and grab his second of the day!

47: The Terriers are straight out of the blocks, as Swansea were in the first half. Aaron Mooy - fresh from Australia duty - an obvious target for passes.

Jonathan Hogg is replaced by Aaron Mooy for the second half and we are back underway!


Jordan Ayew curls the free-kick just wide and that's the half!
The goal probably came against the run of play, but it was a poor mistake from the goalkeeper and Tammy Abraham does not miss from there!

45+2: Zanka chops down Carroll as he picks up Abraham's through ball and goes into the book as a result. Free-kick in a dangerous position here.

And from that goal-kick Jonas Lossl has gifted Swansea the lead!
He takes it short and in the direction of Zanka, but it's so weak and Ayew is there ready to pounce. He stands in the way of Lossl as the ball falls to Tom Carroll, who cuts back for Abraham to do what he does best! 1-0 Swansea!

41: Ayew and Fer exchange passes, with the latter finding Olsson on the left. He wins a throw, but it's wasted and Lossl has the goal-kick.

38: Patient build-up from the visitors as the back four exchange passes with one another. Swansea are in no hurry to press. Jordan Ayew takes one for the team and barges into Kachunga about 30 yards out; Wagner's men have a free-kick, but Tammy Abraham puts his defensive qualities on show as he rises to head away.

35: There's a mellow tempo to the game overall here, but there's some big tackles being made across the pitch. Just the one booking so far.


30: Jonathan Low feels aggrieved after he battles with Narsingh and concedes a free-kick but Lossl is equal to the dipping effort meant for the head of Fernandez.
31: There's huge questions for half-time here though! Tom Ince races onto a long ball out from Lossl and bears down on goal but he's bundled to the floor by Martin Olsson just inside the area! That looked incredibly contentious, but Paul Tierney has given nothing!

27: CLOSE! Elias Kachunga capitalises on Alfie Mawson's error, but is brought down by Britton about 25 yards out. 
The free-kick is taken short and though the initial aftermath is slow, Tom Ince has a golden opportunity to open the scoring, but he blazes over from van La Parra's teasing cross.
Not the best effort, but probably the pick of the bunch so far.

25: YELLOW! Our first card of the day is handed to Christopher Schindler as he hesitates on a clearance and takes Leroy Fer with him in the process.

23: Ince takes, but Fer nods away at the near post. Huddersfield have the ball now though and Kachunga makes headway down the left before trying to knock a shot past Fabianski at the near post; the former Arsenal man has that in his grasp.

22: Huddersfield are starting to impose themselves now and win a corner after Fer deflects Low's cross over the bar and behind.

19: David Wagner's men are struggling with the fast break the Swans have in their locker, but danger is averted for the Yorkshire side this time as Luciano Narsingh's curling cross drops wide of the post.

17: Bit of controversy here as the referee plays advantage with Kyle Naughton again floored. The Terriers play on and win a corner on the left hand side - van La Parra swings it in, but it's above everyone and out of play.

15: Huddersfield are trying to settle into the game with a bit of possession here, but Swansea interrupt proceedings and break again. 
Naughton is down after van La Parra steps on his toes on the right flank and Swansea have another free-kick. Carroll delivers, but it's tame and straight into the hands of Lossl.

13: Carroll delivers a corner from the right this time, but Paul Tierney blows his whistle and penalises Leroy Fer for a foul in the area. Huddersfield haven't had much in the way of attacks as yet.

10: Schindler gives away a free-kick on the right touchline after a cynical challenge on Jordan Ayew. Carroll delivers, but it's poor in truth and the Terriers clear their lines.

8: SAVED! Sloppy defending from Zanka with the clearance and there's a chance for Tammy Abraham after Carroll's ball over the top but his shot is well saved by Lossl.
9: A second corner is delivered, but it's immediately lumped away by Schindler at the near post.

6: CHANCE! Naughton picks out Narsingh with a lovely ball out from defence, but his cross is far too close to the byline and it's behind. Tammy Abraham was lurking there.

4: Decent run down the left from Huddersfield's Hogg, but as he gets his cross away it picks up plenty of altitude and Swansea have the ball once again.

2: It's Swansea doing most of the pressing in the early minutes, but there's a bit of drama here as goalkeeper Jonas Lossl is down following a nasty collision with Leroy Fer.
There's a little bit of concern but he's up and takes the goal kick as if nothing happened.

Referee Paul Tierney purses his lips, raises the whistle and gets this afternoon's Premier League action underway!
It's Huddersfield in their rather jazzy red strip who kick things off.

Catch highlights of Watford's dramatic draw with West Brom here.

It's finished all-square at the Hawthorns. Holebas' free-kick onto the head of the young Richarlison in the final minute of stoppage time has rescued a point for Watford.

It's a superb delivery and Richarlison simply has to get his head onto the ball to direct it past Ben Foster. Watford have yet again shown their resolve. From 2-0 down, they've snatched a point!

90+4: It's now or never for Watford as McClean brings down Richarlison to be yellow carded. Everyone is up. Gomes is on his way.

90+4: Gomes hammers the ball forward. The fans are whistling, the linesman flags for offside. West Brom are nearly there.

90+3: Cleverley and Pereyra link up but Gibbs heads clear. Dawson then has to block off Deeney to complete the clearance. On the counter-attack, it's brilliant from Robson-Kanu to find McClean, and it's a superb saving tackle from Holebas. McClean can't believe it! Corner West Brom.

90: Watford have committed plenty of men forward, as Rodriguez is penalised right in front of a distraught Tony Pulis. Cannot be anything too sophisticated now from Watford. We're into four additional minutes.

88: Pereyra tries to dribble past Evans on the right, but the defender hauls him down to concede a free-kick. Evans joins Livermore in going into the book.

87: Livermore goes into the book for a cynical foul as Watford look to break.

86: Mariappa fouls Robson-Kanu. West Brom won't be in any rush to take this free-kick. Gibbs swings it in, and Gomes comes to punch clear.

85: No real urgency about Watford's pursuit of an equaliser. West Brom standing firm as Holebas brings the ball forward and lays it onto Richarlison, but his cross is straight into the arms of Foster.

81: More good running from Robson-Kanu as he gets into the channel to receive Dawson's pass but his cross takes a deflection back off him last and goes behind for a goal-kick.

80: We're into the final 10 minutes then at The Hawthorns. Can Watford rescue a point? 

77: West Brom have enjoyed a period of possession following that spate of substitutions. The hosts' depth of squad has been evident this afternoon with McClean and Livermore providing real quality. 
They're ready to roll their sleeves up to dig deep for these three points as Richarlison is hounded out by three West Brom defenders. Gray loses the ball when he could have laid it off for Cleverley to get a shot on target. 

74: Robson-Kanu has brought renewed energy to the West Brom attack, and he wins another free-kick. Hegazi, Evans and Dawson have the chance to go up, but this time Watford clear their lines.

73: Andre Carrillo, who had that big chance earlier in the game for Watford, makes way for Andre Gray. Watford will go two up top now, with the former Burnley striker paired alongside Troy Deeney.

71: Hal Robson-Kanu comes on for Rondon. He's straight into the action as he feeds McClean whose shot is tipped around the post by Gomes.

70: More good play from the lively Richarlison on the left-hand side. He has three options in the box, but it's just his end product that's letting him down. The cross is fired through but no-one was getting on the end of that.

68: Livermore is late on Carrillo giving Watford a free-kick which Hegazi clears, but the ball is fed to Doucoure.  the cross finds Richarlison at the far post but his header wide comes after shove on Gibbs.

67: Cleverley lofts a lovely pass to Holebas, who does really well to cut inside Rodriguez who has tracked back on the right, but his ball is over-hit. It was another good opening for Watford. Pulis has made a tactical change with Rodriguez and McClean now swapping wings.

65: Kabasele gives away a cheap free-kick for a foul on Rodriguez. West Brom needed that to ease the pressure. Krychowiak's delivery is punched clear by Gomes.

61: CHANCE! It's a brilliant ball from Holebas that goes right into the danger area, but Hegazi and Kabasele seem to be dragging each other at the same time. No penalty but a chance of an equaliser there.

59: Watford's change is Roberto Pereyra for Capoue. And both he and McClean are straight into the action with the former winning a corner after a slip on the byline by Foster.

59: Watford are enjoying good possession. You can see how much this side is an upgrade on last season. They're a real threat, with quality in wide positions too. They're ready to make their first change of the day, but first Jake Livermore comes on for Chris Brunt.

58: FOUL! Dawson leaves a kick on Richarlison, and he has every right to protest to Oliver that he's not getting enough protection. It's not the first time that Dawson has been late on him.

57: And with that, Phillips has been substituted and James
McClean comes on in his place. It's a like-for-like change.

56: Evans clears another good ball into the box by Femenia, and Barry again performs a human shield to block another Capoue thunderbolt. Foster gathers from Femenia's ball. It's all Watford at the moment, but in Phillips West Brom have an out ball. 

53: BLOCK! Watford are very nearly level as Gibbs' clearance falls straight to Capoue, but the former Tottenham midfielder's low fizzing shot deflects off Gareth Barry and behind. That shot was travelling towards the bottom corner!

52: Another solid challenge from Evans on Richarlison. It's clear that Pulis has told his players to let the Brazilian know he's in a game as he was having an increasing influence of that first half. 
Watford regain the ball down the right with Femenia, and his teasing ball goes all the way through. Carillo needed to gamble there!

50: Good persistence shown from Gibbs to win a corner off Femenia. Have Watford learned their lesson? They have on this occasion as the ball is cleared, as far as Matt Phillips. He gets his shot away but it's a comfortable save low down for Gomes.

49: Here's another problem for Richarlison as he recieves a knock to the small of his back off Brunt. Oliver waves play on, before Rondon fouls Mariappa.

47: There was an instant bump to head for Richarlison from Dawson but he's OK to continue. Watford are straight onto the attack but Brunt clears Femenia's delivery.

46: We're back under way at the Hawthorns, with Watford kicking us back off. No changes at the interval.

Watford began the game the better of the two sides, but two goals in the space of three minutes gave West Brom a commanding lead through Salomon Rondon and Jonny Evans.
Andre Carillo had a glorious chance to halve the deficit when he somehow headed over from two yards out, but Abdoulaye
Doucoure's goal means we are set for an intriguing second half.

45+2: Watford have a chance to launch one last attack as Dawson concedes a foul on Richarlison. This is happening beyond the allocated added time. But Carrillo's effort is gathered by Foster.

45: We're into two minutes of stoppage time at the end of this first half at The Hawthorns.

44: Sloppy defending allows West Brom a chance to take advantage of a gift from Doucoure, but they play the ball wrong allowing Watford to break. Richarlison cuts inside and tries his luck with a right-footed curler but Foster has this one covered. 

42: Free-kick to West Brom on the left-hand side, and its Brunt to deliver again. He looks to find Hegazi at the far post, but this time it's too heavy and the ball goes out for a goal-kick.

40: Tom Cleverley touches the ball off to Capoue, who strikes low and hard but the ball deflects off Evans and behind for a corner. West Brom just need to hold out until half-time now as the Hornets are coming on strong. Capoue's cross is headed over by Richarlison. They're getting a lot of balls into the box.

A lifeline for Watford as Abdoulaye Doucoure does score during that period of Watford pressure. Richarlison laid the ball into his path, and the midfielder was not closed down quick enough by Jonny Evans. The ball flicks off the defender's boot on its way into Ben Foster's bottom left corner.

34: Watford are coming strong again and it's Richarlison who is causing the problems with a fine header back across goal that is scrambled behind by Brunt under pressure from Deeney.

32: WHAT A MISS! Watford have a glorious chance to halve the deficit. Deeney does really well to cut open the West Brom defence as he threads a pass through to Richarlison. There's pace on the Brazilian's cross but Andre
Carrillo stoops to somehow head the ball over from only two yards out. A big chance comes and goes.

31: CHANCE! Evans looks for Dawson, who helps the ball onto Rondon, but Kabasele gets across to concede the corner. Brunt is standing over it, and his time he finds Hegazi but his header at the far post goes over the bar! Gomes is very lucky as he misjudged the flight of the cross.


30: Watford decide it's their turn to go direct as Kiko
Femenia sprays a diagonal ball onto the head of Richarlison, but his effort is looped comfortably into the arms of Ben Foster.

28: More encouraging work fro mWest Brom as Rodriguez fires the ball into Rondon and continues his run. The striker lays the ball back to Brunt who sees the third man running in Rodriguez, and the forward gets his shot away, albeit the ball sails over the bar. There's cutting edge about West Brom today, and that's been the difference.

25: Watford manager Marco Silva is a very unhappy man on the sidelines as he remonstrates with his assistant about those two sloppy goals. 
Gomes will feel he ought to have done better with both goals. He was beaten far too easily at his near post for Rondon's strike and his positioning was suspect for the second. Goals from set plays, though, is the Albion way. 20 of their 43 goals last season came from set pieces.

21: West Brom well and truly have their tails up, and now they lead 2-0. Gibbs wins a corner, and from Brunt's ensuing delivery, Watford midfielder Doucoure flicks the ball on to the grateful Jonny Evans at the far post. It's escalated very quickly for the Hornets.

18: This is route one football at its best. Grzegorz
Krychowiak looks up and sees Salomon Rondon is already on his bike. The big forward allows the ball to drop over his shoulder, and he then out-muscles Kabasele, before sliding the ball beyond Gomes from a narrow angle.


16: Deeney loses the ball, and West Brom break swiftly through Craig Dawson. Albion are just starting to emerge from their slumbers. The move failed to materialise despite an awful clearance from Christian
Kabasele but that has got the crowd singing. The Watford full-backs were caught high up the pitch and they were thankful to Capoue for eventually clearing.

We've brought you all the reaction from The Amex and now the time has come for us to bid you farewell. Stay tuned across the Sky Sports platforms for more post-match content after Brighton edged past Newcastle to claim their second Premier League victory of the season. Thanks for joining us, we hope to see you for this tasty line-up in the coming week!

That's all from the managers, Chris Hughton understandably in good spirits while Rafa Benitez, shall we say, was keen to get a few things off his chest! 

"No, not really. I am happy that we won - whoever it was against. The best way to look at it is that there are lot of similarity between the two teams. The nicest thing was to compare ourselves with Newcastle and win."


"We have to build on a solid platform. We are not going to be able to away from home and score a lot of goals. What I would hope we can do away from home is to stay in every game."

"We have made headway. Newcastle have deserved to win their last three games and play similarly to how we do formation-wise. It was nice to win but Newcastle would look at it that they're still two points above of us."

"Home form will be important, more will be at home than away from home. We have to make sure this is a tough place to come, we've been good here the last few seasons."

"What you saw is what you see in every game. It wasn't a foul, it was what you see in matches. Hemed had a lot of work to do and it was a great finish."

"My first impression is that there was absolutely no intent."

"I am delighted and very pleased with the manner of how we won. Once we got the goal it was difficult, especially when Shelvey came on, but we defended well. It was a good overall performance against a very good counter-attacking team."

“I didn’t see it. I didn’t see this game as a tough game with
a lot of bad tackles.”

“We are more focused on football. When you finish the
transfer window you have concentrate on the football. We are short in some areas but
we can do well as a team and compete against anyone.”

“We have to learn from this defeat to take your chances in
the Premier League.”

"We did enough to get a point at least. We had a lot of
chances and for me the goal was a foul for blocking. It’s so clear but you
cannot change the decision."

“I’m frustrated. We did some good things they had
chances we had chances. We’re disappointed because the goal is a foul, and the
referee had a very good position (to see).”


Chris Hughton and Rafa Benitez are just carrying out
their post-match media duties with the TV and radio broadcasters and then we’ll
have the best lines from their press conference with the written media. Stay
tuned.

Tomer Hemed and Dale Stephens believe Brighton deserved their 1-0 win against Newcastle and say it will spur them on for their next match.



Let's hear from Brighton boss Chris Hughton, who has been speaking to Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves.
“It was a hard fought victory. There weren’t masses between
the two teams but when you are the home team you sometimes get a little bit
more in their favour. But the one opportunity we had we took in what was a
tight game. We had to dig deep at times but we deserved it.”


Thierry Henry thought Brighton full deserved their win.
"What I like about Brighton is they know what they are all
about. They have to work hard, that’s how they are going to win games. They are
not going to win games because they have amazing quality in their team,
especially in this league. But they work really hard."



Let’s get some reaction from Brighton…
Dale Stephens: “We deserved it overall. We worked really
hard and we got our rewards in the end.”
Tomer Hemed: “In the last few games we’ve played well and
this win can give us a push for the next game. We deserved it.”

Here's what Sky Sports' co-commentator had to say on Tomer Hemed's performance.
“In the first half he lacked a bit of anticipation when the
ball was bouncing around the six-yard box but he was alive when that header
came across from Dale Stephens and took his chance really well. His hold-up
play has been good, his work-rate is good too. He’s a real team player and he’s
had a good afternoon.”

Here's how that result has affected the Premier League table.

There are joyous scenes at the Amex. The home fans certainly enjoyed that after Tomer Hemed scored the only goal of the game to give Chris Hughton's side all three points.

FT: And it is! The final whistle goes and it's met by a huge roar from the home fans.

90+3: YELLOW! Murphy brings the ball clear for Brighton and he's hauled down by Lascelles. That could be the game for Brighton.

90+2: Shelvey lofts the ball into the box and Lascelles is up to win the flick on. Gayle tries to latch onto the ball but Bruno is alert to the danger, heading the ball to safety.

90: There will be THREE minutes off added time.

90: BLOCK! The balls to Shelvey 20 yards from goal and he powers the ball goalwards. Dunk throws his body at the ball, making a crucial block.

88: Man of the Match? Sky Sports' co-commentator Andy Hinchcliffe has named Tomer Hemed as the man of the match.

87: Shelvey, who has certainly made a difference since he's come on, finds space on the left. he drives to the byline before playing a low cross into the box, which is cleared at the near post.

86: Jesus Gamez wins a corner for the visitors, who are roared on by the travelling supporters. Shelvey whips the ball into the box but it's cleared by Hemed.

84: WIDE! Jesus Gamez is straight into the action. He makes a good connection with the ball, striking the bouncing ball goalwards but it flashes wide of Ryan's near post.

83: SUB! Newcastle make their final change, Mbemba is replaced by Jesus Gamez.

81: SUB! Konockaert is replaced by Murphy for the hosts. The winger is visibly not happy with the decision but accepts it, shaking Chris Hughton's hand as he comes off the pitch.

79: PENALTY? Shelvey's bundled to the floor in the penalty area by Bruno. Newcastle want a penalty but the referee waves away the appeals as the ball falls to Atsu at the far post. The Ghana international gets a shot away but it hasn't got enough power to trouble Ryan.

77: FREE-KICK! Shelvey steps up to take it but he cannot get enough dip on the ball to hit the target. The Brighton fans enjoyed that as the ironic cheers go up around the Amex.

“Rafa Benitez has cut a frustrated figure just in front
of me in the dug-out, and he’s reacted by bringing on Shelvey and Gayle.
Shelvey has dropped so deep he looks like he’s playing at centre-half! But don't be alarmed Newcastle fans, from there his passing expertise has got the visitors right up the pitch and on the
front foot. The pair of substitutes filled their boots in the Championship last
season, are they the remedy to Newcastle's misfortune here so far?”

74: POST! Shelvey trots over to take the corner and he fires it into the near post. He's gone for goal and he's so close to grabbing an equaliser as the ball rebounds off the post.

73: The subs are straight into the action. Shelvey pings a beautiful pass forward for Gayle, forcing Dunk to head behind for a Newcastle corner.

71: SUB! Another change for Newcastle as Gayle replaces Joselu.

69: SUB! Newcastle turn to Shelvey, who replaces Hayden. Can he make a difference?

68: Dunk gives the ball away to Perez in a dangerous position. The Spaniard back heels the ball into the path of Ritchie, who fires wide from 25 yards.

67: Knockaert twists and turns his way down the left and has the opportunity to whip in a cross. However, he takes one too many turns, allowing Mbemba to get a foot in and win the ball back for Newcastle.

64: Suttner plays the ball into the box but Lascelles is well positioned to clear. Brighton recycle the ball and Suttner has another chance to deliver from the left but this time Mbemba heads clear for the visitors.



FT: One last ball in the box by Chelsea, but Tarkowski has the answer again! What a game he's had!
More pinball in the box as Alonso drills a low ball in, but Morata can't turn it home!
THAT'S IT! Thrilling, thrilling game at Stamford Bridge, and the champions are beaten despite an unbelievable fightback in the second half with NINE men! The boos are for Craig Pawson, the referee, but in fairness to him, the big decisions were correct.

90+4: Stunning, stunning game of football, and with 60 seconds remaining, Burnley look to have won this.  

90+3: Long ball into the box from the free-kick, but it's ushered out of play.

90+2: Free kick to Chelsea, a chance to pile the box! Christensen comes off, Musonda is on.

90+1: Four minutes added on! Huge roar around the Bridge!

90: Pawson awards Burnley a free-kick just on the edge of the box as Vokes is sandwiched by Rudiger and Luiz. Luiz already has a booking, and it's hard to tell who makes the contact?!
OFF THE POST! Brady takes, and hits the bottom of the post with a fine effort!

GAME ON!!! Azpilicueta piles it forward, Morata flicks it on brilliantly for Luiz behind the defence, and he volleys home!
Can the NINE men of Chelsea save this?!

88: Chelsea are still piling forward. Morata appeals for a push, Willian has the ball in acres at an angle, but Mee eventually clears. 

85: Morata fights well on the edge of the box to shoot, but Cork gets a deflection to take the sting out of it, and Heaton saves easily.

83: What a nightmare for the champions. '3-1 to the referee' sing the Stamford Bridge crowd, but he's got that decision spot on. He's been very card happy this afternoon, but that's a definite yellow.
What was Fabregas playing at? His earlier yellow was for a sarcastic clap at Pawson, who won't be getting many Christmas cards from Chelsea fans.

81: RED CARD FOR FABREGAS! Wow. Chelsea are down to nine. 
Fabregas is shown a second yellow card, and he is absolutely apoplectic with the officials. He flies in on Cork, may take a bit of the ball, but Cork got their first. It's a definite yellow.

81: The ball falls to Kante on the edge of the box, he aims for the top left-hand corner, but gets a little too much movement on it, much to the relief of Tom Heaton. 

79: Morata is offside from Alonso's left-wing ball, and Luiz is furious with the officials. Yellow card for him now.

77: Arfield goes very high and late on Alonso.  I'm not sure he catches him, but a deserved yellow from Pawson. 

75: Double sub for Burnley. Arfield and Walters are on, Gudmundsson and Defour come off.

73: BALL IN THE NET! But Morata is offside! Christensen is found on the right behind the defence, he takes a touch and crosses for Morata to slot into the empty net, but the Spaniard is just offside!
Right decision, but if Morata had left the ball, it may have sneaked in!

71: Chelsea have a spring in their step now. Knocking the ball about nicely. Azpilicueta crosses first time after some nice build-up, but Heaton comes out to collect.

The debutant scores! Willian curls in a beautiful ball from the right, finding Morata onside as he drifts inbetween the Burnley centre-halves. 
He's six yards out, and glances a header into the corner past Heaton! Game on!

67: Brady sneaks in at the far post from Gudmundsson's deep ball, but Willian distracts him enough and he heads wide. 


65: Intelligent run by Morata, Mee has to fly in, and is booked. Chelsea want a red, but Pawson is keeping that in his pocket for now.
Fabregas crosses, Luiz is unmarked on the volley, but he doesn't catch it well enough. Over the bar.

Paul Merson has reacted to the introduction of club-record signing Alvaro Morata at the Bridge, calling it a "shocking decision".
Merse is calling it "damage limitation", with the Spaniard replacing Batshuayi in attack rather than Chelsea going for it by playing two men up front.

63: Brady booked for a body check on Willian, 30 yards out. 
SAVE! Alonso strikes it superbly with his left, but Heaton tips it over well! Good starting position from the Burnley stopper.

61: Morata not shy. He picks the ball up 30 yards out and has a go, but it flies well over the bar. Strangely, the Chelsea fans applaud. 

60: Alvaro Morata comes on for his Premier League debut.  replacing Michy Batshuayi for the final 30 minutes.

59: Corner Burnley, Brady finds Vokes at the back post but he can't get enough on his header and it floats wide. 

57: Fabregas wins the ball from behind on Kendrick.  but Pawson awards a free-kick. The Blues fans are absolutely furious here.

55: Chelsea with a pen appeal. Alonso crosses, it hits the arm of Lowton, who has it quite close to his body, and Pawson just about correctly waves play on. Unintentional. 

53: Alonso pushes forward again down the left, but his deflected cross just goes behind for a corner.
That's cleared by Vokes, who has been superb so far, but here come Chelsea again

51: SAVE! Fine stop from Heaton as he tips over Alonso's long-range effort! He then gathers the corner at the second attempt, and Burnley survive. 
Chelsea pushing early in the second half. 

49: NO shots on target for Chelsea so far. Rudiger has a go from range but it's wide.
Also, no Premier League champion has ever conceded three goals on the opening day of the following season.

47: Conte has changed the system again. They've gone four at the back, Christensen right-back, Rudiger and Luiz in the middle, Alonso left.

46: Back underway at the Bridge.


HT: Boos ring out at the Bridge, but they're mainly reserved for referee Craig Pawson. They're furious, and that Cahill red card will be debated for some time.
Can Chelsea claw back any pride? Or have Burnley got this won?
It's 24 years since they first lost their opening game at home, Chelsea.

45: Kante attempts to bend one into the far corner from the edge, but it's deflected out for a corner. Burnley eventually clear after some pinball.
Shocked faces in the Stamford Bridge crowd.

This is unbelievable. Conte wanted to avoid having a 'Mourinho season'.  but it's started off with more than a touch of deja vu for the Stamford Bridge crowd.
Defour with a lovely cross from the right, and it's plum on Vokes' head as he steers it past Courtois, but the striker managed to get in-between Luiz and Alonso with ease there.
Nobody was expecting this.  even with 10 men!

41: Just as it looked like Chelsea may be putting the pressure on for an equaliser, Burnley score from nowhere. Ward, who has scored just two Premier League goals for Burnley, with a stunner.

WOW! Burnley go two up in fine fashion! 
Ward picks the ball up on the left of the box from Cork's lofted ball. Ward takes a superb touch to set himself up from the angle, and then fires past Courtois into the far corner with a fine half volley on his left foot!
Beautifully worked, and a nightmare start for the champions!

39: Chelsea have had more of the ball, 58 per cent, than Burnley, but not doing much with it so far. Tarkowski in particular has been a rock in defence for the visitors. 

37: Burnley penned into their half now as Chelsea look for an equaliser. Azpilicueta, now captain, has seen plenty of the ball down the right. 

35: Chelsea working hard in the final third. Kante does well to win the ball off Defour, but his through ball for Azpilicueta is out of play.

33: Alonso cuts in from the left onto his right foot, looks for the bottom right corner, but Tarkowski is superbly placed yet again.

31: Chelsea fans very frustrated here. Burnley are defending well when the hosts do form an attack, and here comes Lowton down the right again.
He plays it into Brady, but Rudiger puts in a superb challenge.


28: Burnley fans loving this so far, and they're having all the possession. Brady crosses, but Luiz clears. 
Sarcastic applause as Fabregas is awarded a free-kick.

26: Defour has seen so much of the ball early on in midfield. With a rare attack, Willian nearly forces his way through, but Tarkowski again intercepts. He's had a fine game so far.

Burnley have knocked the champions off their feet! Matt Lowton has the ball on the right and has plenty of time to cross.
It's behind Vokes as the ball comes into the area about 12 yards out, but he flicks it onto the bottom far corner past Courtois! Disastrous start for Chelsea.

22: The game is a lot more frantic now as Burnley look to catch Chelsea on the backfoot. Stamford Bridge still digesting that red card, which Merse says was just about deserved. 


All over at Watford, where Manchester City have produced a sensational performance.
Sergio Aguero was the star of the show, scoring a hat-trick, but Kevin de Bruyne, David Silva and Gabriel Jesus were equally excellent.
City's last three games - they have won 5-0, 4-0 and 6-0. Ominous. 

90+3: SHOT! Aguero turns and blasts on goal from 25 yards, Gomes turning it away. Nearly a fourth for the Argentine.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

Sterling takes the spot-kick himself after a brief conversation with Aguero - they both turned to Pep Guardiola and in the end Sterling was allowed to take it.
What a penalty too, straight into the top corner.

88: PENALTY TO CITY! Sterling wins a spot-kick after Kabasele takes him down. An easy decision for referee Taylor.

86: CLOSE! Nearly a sixth for City as Sterling moves the ball onto his left foot and fires a low shot towards the far corner. It looks destined for the net but takes a slight deflection. Unlucky.

84: It could be back-to-back 5-0 wins for Pep Guardiola's side in the Premier League. Shame they only managed 4-0 in the Champions League in midweek.

His 10th hat-trick for Manchester City - and what a finish!
Aguero surges into the Watford box, weaving past a number of challenges, before flicking the ball past Gomes from a tight angle.
It hits the post and goes in, despite the best efforts of Kabasele on the line.

81: Mendy has been up and down City's left flank all afternoon and powers forward again, winning a corner.
Sane takes to Sterling on the edge of the box but Deeney snaps in with a firm challenge. 

78: SUB! And City make their final change as David Silva is withdrawn, replaced by Leroy Sane.

75: CHANCE! Another City break almost leads to a goal as Aguero bursts forward and tees up Sterling. The winger may be trying to find Aguero in the middle but either way, his low effort drifts wide of the far post.

75: SUB! Watford make their final change as Andre Gray is replaced by Troy Deeney.

73: CHANCE! Watford should be on the scoresheet! A corner is flicked on at the near post and Capoue is unmarked at the back stick but somehow nods over the crossbar. A sitter.

72: Holebas delivers another decent free-kick for Watford but Ederson - sporting his headgear - is bravely out to punch clear.

69: SUB! Chalobah is replaced by Etienne Capoue.


66: SUB! Kevin de Bruyne is off - a magnificent performance - as Ilkay Gundogan replaces the Belgian.

65: SUBS! Gabriel Jesus is replaced by Bernardo Silva for City, while Watford bring on Pereyra for Tom Cleverley.

City make it four from the resulting corner - some of their crossing has been spectacular today.
Silva takes it short and receives the return pass, before whipping a fine delivery into the middle.
Otamendi is there to power a header into the net. No chance for Gomes.

63: SAVE! Aguero holds up play well and feeds Silva with a back-heel. The Spaniard tries to blast his shot past Gomes from a tight angle but the goalkeeper tips it over.

61: Watford have improved. but City look lethal on the counter. 
Sterling leads another charge, finding Silva, who helps it to Mendy. The French full-back drives a low cross into the danger area and Watford somehow smuggle it away for a corner. That was nearly an own goal.

60: Watford have certainly improved in the second half - they force another corner as Otamendi clears under no pressure. He needed a shout from his team-mates.
The delivery from Holebas is a good one but Richarlison flicks over. He wants a corner but it's not forthcoming.

57: Richarlison takes a knock to the head from Walker and referee Taylor stops play, halting a City counter-attack. The Watford man is fine to continue.

54: NO PENALTY! Chalobah wants a spot-kick after Otamendi is a little heavy-handed with his challenge in the area following a Watford corner.
Referee Anthony Taylor is not interested and Chalobah can't convince him otherwise despite a minute-long conversation at the next break in play.

52: City respond with a spell of pressure themselves, with Jesus dropping deep and causing Watford problems. He pops the ball out to Mendy and the Frenchman wins a corner. 
It is taken short before De Bruyne tries to deliver but for once it's poor and Watford clear.

49: CLOSE! Better from Watford. Holebas storms forward, skipping past Walker and clipping a cross to the far post. It drops to Carrillo and he tries to cut across it with a right-foot strike. But the shot doesn't have enough curl, falling a few yards wide.

46: We are back under way for the second half.

Watford have been sent out early to warm-up for the second half - Marco Silva obviously not too pleased with that first-half display.




A stunning first-half display by City. Watford may argue - fairly - that two of the three goals were offside but the home side have been completely outclassed so far.

45: TWO minutes of added time

43: City celebrate Aguero's opener.

42: This could be a cricket score if Watford aren't careful. They have not got going yet - but all credit to City, they have been excellent.

41: De Bruyne smashes his free-kick about three yards over the crossbar.

40: YELLOW! Doucoure hauls down Sterling as the City forward is bearing down on Watford's defenders. Another free-kick opportunity for the visitors.

Absolutely clinical from City.
But if the first goal was a marginal offside call, this one looks more clear cut and Watford will not be pleased.
Jesus is just ahead of play when Aguero slides his pass through, with the Brazilian dragging his finish into the bottom corner.

36: SAVE! De Bruyne tests Gomes after drifting past Chalobah and driving low on goal. The Watford goalkeeper was equal to it.

35: City are good value for this lead - they have been completely dominant at Vicarage Road so far. They could add one or two more by half-time to really kill this game off.

Aguero loves playing against Watford - that's eight goals in his last five appearances! 
This one is so simple - Jesus slips through Silva, who plays across the six-yard box and Aguero taps home.
Gomes won't want to see the replay - he should have gathered the low cross but could only fumble it through to Aguero.

30: YELLOW! Holebas is in the book for a nasty kick out at De Bruyne, who is not pleased with the challenge.

Aguero shows Richarlison how it's done - a brilliant header! 
The goal comes after Cleverley is fortunate to avoid a yellow card for wiping out Stones, giving City a free-kick.
De Bruyne delivers a beauty and Aguero nods home - although replays suggest the Argentine may have been fractionally offside. It was very, very tight.

25: CLOSE! What a chance for the hosts! Holebas whips in a fantastic free-kick from deep and it's right onto the head of Richarlison but the striker nods a yard wide. Poor defending by City and that almost cost them.

24: The City corner comes to nothing, while Janmaat is back on the pitch and ready to continue after that clash of heads with Otamendi.

22: OUCH! Brave defending by Janmaat, who takes a knock to the head from Otamendi after clearing under heavy pressure from the City defender.
He's off the pitch for treatment, meanwhile it's a corner to City.

21: CHANCE! Another opportunity for City, this time for Aguero, but the striker screws his volley wide after a corner from the left is defected into his path. At the moment it's only a matter of time before the visitors score.

19: TACKLE! A huge challenge by Kabasele! It's loose initially from Chalobah, who concedes possession cheaply to De Bruyne. He passes onto Aguero, who slides a pass through to Sterling but Kabasele recovers to take just enough of the ball. Otherwise that was a penalty.

16: CLOSE! Another fine through ball by De Bruyne releases Aguero and his miscued cross almost drops into the far corner. Gomes was scrambling and was relieved to see it fall onto the roof of the net.

That's all we have from St James' Park today, many thanks for joining us. 
Hit play on the video for match highlights below or scroll down for the updates as they happened. See you next time!

Hear from Rafa Benitez as he spoke to Sky Sports after the game.

Hear what Jurgen Klopp had to say to Sky Sports following the draw.

Rafa – in charming form as usual – admitted he’s never happy
with taking just a point at home, but against a top side, a draw was
acceptable.
Key lines:
“To get a point at home isn’t the best – but we have to be
happy considering it was against Liverpool – a very good side.
“Mane, Coutinho, Solakne, Salah - to stop all of them the whole
time - the lads did a great job.
Happy with 10 points so far? “It could be even more – we deserved
more. I’m not greedy.” 

Jurgen Klopp has been and gone for his presser. He was in a
prickly mood and had a bit of an exchange with a journalist, asking him “have
you ever watched football before” – after he asked him whether he thought
Newcastle deserved their point.
Key lines:
“No drop in confidence – it’s our duty to be confident. If
you try, try, try and it doesn’t work then it is hard. We made one mistake and
got punished.”
“We are not far away from being a real challenger….”




There goes the full time whistle at St James' Park and it's points shared. 
Philippe Coutinho produced a superb goal to put Liverpool ahead but their defensive frailties were exposed again when Joselu was able to tap home the equaliser not long after. 
Stay tuned for match highlights and reaction.

90+2: Ritchie delivers the free kick that lands to Diame at the back post, but the hosts win a corner. 
A similar situation again with the corner coming to Diame in the middle of the box, but his chipped effort is well collected by Mignolet. 

90: Free kick to Newcastle on the right of the box now after a foul from Lovren. 
Diame is now coming on for Perez as three minutes added time are signalled. 

89: CLOSE! Could that have been the winner? It's some superb work from Moreno down the left flank who manages to hack the ball into the middle of the box from the by-line and Oxlade-Chamberlain gets there with a diving header that just flashes wide.
Time running out here.  


88: A cheeky effort from Perez there as Lovren heads an Elliot goal kick into his path. He snaps at it on the half volley and Mignolet is off his line, but the ball flies over the crossbar - thankfully for Liverpool.

85: CLOSE! A lovely ball into the box from Coutinho there and Solanke meets it with a low header that just skews wide of the post. 

84: Here comes the switch with Salah the man to make way for Oxlade-Chamberlain.

83: Kick take two from Elliot as Solanke just gets a bit too close when he takes his first one, handing Newcastle the free kick.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain stripped for Liverpool.

81: Coutinho tries to float it in towards the back post, but Clark rises highest to clear. 

80: Free kick to Liverpool as Wijnaldum slips when caught by Hayden. It's not far from the centre line but Coutinho is still lining it up.

79: Another Newcastle sub as Joselu is replaced by Dwight Gayle.

78: Another Gomez-Solanke near miss there as the defender gets away down the right again, skipping past his marker, but the low cross is pushed behind for a corner. 
Salah delivers and it is headed on by Lovren at the back post, but a strong header on the line by Shelvey sees the ball away from danger. 

76: CLOSE! Solanke right in the thick of the action early on as Gomez whips in a superb ball into the box from the right flank, and Solanke looks to meet it but Elliot is again off his line to punch away the ball before striker can make contact. 

74: Changes from both sides now as Firmino and Solanke come on for Sturridge and Mane while Merino makes way for Isaac Hayden.

73: A poor hit from Joselu as he fires over from the right side of the box.


70: Sturridge is again flagged for offside as Mane plays the ball to him on the right of the box. He looks frustrated with himself and he tried so hard to stay onside - but it didn't quite work. 
Roberto Firmino and Dominic Solanke readied for the Reds.  

69: Some good play from Newcastle there with great control from Atsu into the path of Shelvey. He in turn found Manquillo who tried to pick out the run of Ritchie down the right flank, but the ball just ran too long. 


66: Another Salah-Sturridge link there as the former again plays the striker through, but the offside flag is correctly raised.
There is a brief stop as Sturridge and Yedlin clatter into each other and the Newcastle defender needs a second to recover. 

64: Risky goalkeeping from Elliot but it comes off for him as Salah pumps a fantastic pass forward, looking for Sturridge in the box but the goalkeeper is off his line to smother the ball before the Liverpool forward can get a toe onto it.

62: Not a bad effort from Newcastle as the hosts keep the ball alive from the free kick, with Ritchie heading it back across the face of goal but Mignolet collects before another Newcastle shirt can connect. 

61: Free kick to Newcastle on the far right of the field as Moreno clips Perez who was getting away down the flank. Rather unnecessary to concede you feel but Shelvey and Ritchie are over it.

59: OUCH!! The boos are deafening around the ground as Gomez and Atsu clatter into one another, although the Liverpool defender does catch the Newcastle forward in the face with his knee as he goes up for the high ball. 
The home fans want a red card but it's only a yellow for Gomez. It looked like a nasty one as the medics give Atsu the once over, but he's OK to continue. 

57: Not Coutinho's best effort there as his free kick hammers into the wall. 

55: Credit where credit is due, Matip puts in a good tackle on Atsu who dances away from Gomez on the left wing before making his way into the box, but the Liverpool defender stops him in his tracks before he can do any damage. 
First yellow card of the game is given not long after as Perez is penalised for kicking the ball away after the referee blew his whistle.

53: Joselu is down on the ground and is crying out in pain after a collision with Mane. The Newcastle man tackles the Liverpool forward and gets a boot to the side for his troubles. 

51: CLOSE! Another close chance for Liverpool as Clark fails to deal with a loose pass, swinging at it and missing, and it allows Sturridge the chance to shoot but Elliot makes the save. 
The rebounded ball falls to Salah who is lurking in the box, but his effort goes high over the crossbar. He could have done a lot better with that you feel!

48: Good work from Joselu down the right flank there as he manages to get a cross into the box around Moreno, searching for Ritchie but the Liverpool defence do well to clear. 

Live Newcastle v Liverpool Price Boosts.

46: Liverpool get the game back underway.




There goes the whistle at St James' Park.
An entertaining first half which has seen the two sides of Liverpool. Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring with a superb strike but some poor defensive work at the back allowed Joselu to roll home the equaliser not long after.
Plenty to come in the second half with highlights of the first half on the way! 

45: Two minutes added on at the end of the first half. 

43: Liverpool are hunting for that second goal as we head towards the break with Coutinho trying again to curl home from distance but it flies high and wide of the crossbar this time.

41: It's getting a bit spicy out there now with the second goal really heating up proceedings. 
Liverpool win the free kick as Sturridge is fouled, and there's plenty of pushing and shoving as it's delivered, along with the resulting free kick although the Reds cannot make a meaningful effort from it. 
Yedlin appears to be pulling Lovren down with a big old handful of his shirt and Liverpool should maybe have had a penalty there.

It's the same old story from Liverpool - a moment of brilliance at one end before one of absolute defensive capitulation at the other. 
Shelvey plays a superb ball forward as he spots the run of Joselu in between the two centre-backs, Matip and Lovren. 
The Newcastle man gets away from the duo and onto the ball. As he strikes, Mignolet is off his line as Matip tries to tackle from behind but that only helps the ball go further forward and roll into the back of the net. 
Joselu is chasing it but he does't really need to as the ball bobbles over the line. Matip and Mignolet are on the floor and they know that it's poor from them.

35: Boos from the home fans as Mane goes to ground after he is clipped by Shelvey. He gestures to the referee that it is the second time he has been fouled. One to keep an eye on.

33: Good defending from Ciaran Clarke there as he manages to poke the ball out of Salah's path as the Egyptian looked to cross for Sturridge. 
Liverpool have the corner but Newcastle manage to get it away without too much incident this time.

A superb goal from Coutinho and Liverpool take the lead!
A great work rate down the left flank from Moreno sees the ball headed away by Ritchie at the top of the Newcastle box, but it lands at the feet of the one man you don't want it to - Coutinho.
He doesn't even have that much room as he strides forwards and curls an effort around Shelvey that flies into the back of the net. Wonderful.

Liverpool v Manchester United at Anfield is over for another year - as we witnessed another stifling job by Jose Mourinho on Jurgen Klopp.
We've got all the reaction flowing into our digital platforms. Feel free to take a look. Until next time..

Jose Mourinho felt his Manchester United team lacked the power and energy needed to get the victory at Liverpool.

You struggle to keep up with Jurgen Klopp at times but as his press conference finishes you get the sense he is relatively pleased with today's result.

Klopp: I didn’t
see the situation, everybody has told me about it. We should have had a penalty
though, for sure.

Klopp: We are
working hard. Could we do better, yes. Could we have done a lot better in this
game, I don’t think so. They players played as well as they can, there were no
injuries so we can go again on Tuesday and again on Sunday. We will carry on.





Klopp:
It was obvious they were more defensive. We were dominant, as we should be, I’m
OK with performance. It’s not my job to judge the Manchester United
performance. Our performance gives me enough reason to stay positive. 


Short and sweet from Jose Mourinho, who bizarrely blames
Jurgen Klopp for not giving him the chance to win the game. I’ve heard it all now!

Mourinho: You’ll
say we were defensive and they were offensive. They were at home and didn’t move
anything. He did well and didn’t let the game break. Can and Wijnaldum were
very good from a defensive point of view.

Mourinho: We
came for three. In the second half we felt difficult to do that with the match
dynamics. I was waiting for Jurgen to change for him to go more attacking, but
he kept the three strongest players on in positions where they were having
control. He kept the strong midfield and that midfield was stronger than mine.

“I think it’s a missed opportunity. At the start of the
season this wouldn’t have been the worst result for Liverpool but because they’ve
dropped points already this season, you felt Liverpool would make a push."

“I try to react quickly – I put my foot there and I saved
the ball. It’s good. It was all instinct.”

Both Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho have been carrying out their post-match duties with the broadcasters, but stay tuned here for all the best of their post-match press conferences. Who do you think will be happier with the point?

“He sacrificed possession today – he set his team up not to
get beat. You think of Matip’s chance and Can’s effort – but apart from that
Liverpool didn’t work De Gea. Manchester United leave here the happier team.”

“It was a great save by De Gea. I have to score – we win
this game if I score. His reaction was brilliant.”


Manchester United - temporarily at least - move ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table. City host Stoke at 3pm.

FT: History has repeated itself here. A classic Mourinho defensive display frustrated the hosts, who did all the pressing but couldn't find a way past De Gea and his defensive comrades. United remain unbeaten and seven points ahead of Liverpool - they move top of the Premier League (for now, City are playing Stoke this afternoon). Stay tuned for reaction..

90+1: CHANCE! Oxlade-Chamberlain whips a deep effort that finds Lovren jumping above his man about 12 yards out. He can't direct it on target though. Miles over. That might just be that..
SUB! Lindelhof replaces Young. 

89: Oxlade-Chamberlain beats his man down the right. His cross is cleared at the near post by Smalling. Corner to Liverpool.
Three minutes added on. 

Is Jose set to leave Anfield with a goalless draw for the second year in a row?

87: SUB! One last throw. Solanke on for Firmino. 

86: United get their foot on the ball at just the right time. The quality shown by them on the ball - bar the Lukaku chance - has been woeful, as just described by Gary Neville on commentary. 

"It has been a
frustrating second half for Liverpool, who have had the ball and the play but they can’t get the moment they want yet."

83: Sturridge wins a free-kick off Matic after a clever shimmy. 
Henderson tries to hang one up to the back post but Sturridge can't get any real purchase on the effort. Dribbles wide. 

81: Oxlade-Chamberlain speeds away down the right and flicks a ball over for Sturridge to attack. Jones gets there first. United clear their lines again. 

"It's like for like. Klopp's not willing to disrupt that midfield and take Wijnaldum, Can or Henderson off. That is telling."

78: SUB! Oxlade-Chamberlain & Sturridge on. Coutinho & Salah replaced. 

77: United haven't had a shot on goal this half, which sums up their desire to win this game. Liverpool have had nine, but the important stat is the one above. Sturridge is being readied..

75: YELLOW! Smalling gets too tight to Salah on the half-way line. It's taken 75 minutes but we have our first caution..

73: Woeful set-piece from Herrera. With Matic, Jones and Smalling waiting he hoofs a free-kick from 40 yards straight out for a goal-kick. So poor.

71: CLOSE! Only one team wants to win this one. Coutinho flicks a lovely ball to Firmino down the inside left. Salah darts to the back post and Firmino tries to find him with a looped cross. Salah needed to be a few inches higher..  it goes out for a goal kick.

68: Firmino breaks into space down the left. He has support in the middle. It's a clever cross which deceives Jones but the ball rolls across the face and straight into the arms of De Gea. 

66: SHOT! Liverpool still doing the pressing. Salah works himself into space about 25 yards out. He tries a flashy effort but it flies well wide of De Gea's goal. 

63: SUB! Mkhitaryan is replaced by Lingard. 

0-0 is 13/8, 1-0 the the hosts is 7/2 and 1-0 to the visitors 5/1.

61: NO PEN! Coutinho is running the show. He dances past three United men on the edge of the box. Herrera takes a bit of a swipe and gets nowhere near the ball. Coutinho stays on his feet then goes down a couple of seconds later. Nothing given - but replays showed Herrera was playing a dangerous game. 

"That’s a big moment. The question was what part of the body
does Can go with? Could he head it? He went with the left foot and it looked
awkward."

56: CHANCE!! Gomez doesn't waste any time getting the ball in the box. Jones and Smalling are nowhere and Can meets the cross from 10 yards. It's a shocking finish though as he awkwardly punts the ball over the crossbar. That was Liverpool's best chance of the half. 

55: Liverpool dominating here. Coutinho links with Firmino  before striking an effort from 25 yards. It's blocked by Herrera into Wijnaldum's path but he hooks a lobbed effort from 18 yards over the crossbar. 

“I think Coutinho has been the best player on the pitch, certainly
from Liverpool’s point of view. I’ve been critical of how long Klopp takes over
his substutions. 
"Coutinho in that midfield role has been outstanding but when
do you bring an extra attacker on? Klopp usually waits until the 70/75 minute
mark. I hope we see movement around the hour.”

53: OFFSIDE! Excellent from Coutinho. He finds space and threads a ball through for Firmino, who reaches this one. The flag goes up. Firmino's effort was blocked away by De Gea anyway. 

It was his 80th birthday this week - and Sir Bobby Charlton is hoping Manchester United can give him an extra present at Anfield.

51: Coutinho finds space again. He jinks into a dangerous area and Firmino bursts in behind.. he looks the for the pass but the ball deflects straight to De Gea.

49: SHOT! Klopp is liking what he sees here. Coutinho again moves into space off the left. He hits an effort from 20 yards which deflects off Valencia and thumps into the side netting. De Gea had it covered, mind.

"It was sloppy from Phil Jones to give the ball away. Liverpool are at their
absolute best when they win the ball high but they haven’t had many chances to
do that so far."

47: PRESSURE! Liverpool open up United down the left. Coutinho twists and turns in the box. His cross deflects into the six yard box towards Firmino who is beaten to the ball by Smalling. The ball then nearly drops to Salah for the tap-in but the linesman's flag cuts short the attack. 

45: We are back. Still all to play for - who will strike first? United kick-off..

In the Sky Sports studio, Thierry Henry said: "Lukaku needed to keep that chance low, it was the right
height for Mignolet. When he received that ball he was not in the right frame
of mind."
On Lukaku's clash with Lovren towards the end of the first half, Graeme Souness added: "His left foot is tied up with Lovren. I have to believe that boy [Lukaku] didn’t
mean it."

Lukaku remains a Price Boost to open the scoring - he's 11/2 from 5/1 at present. It's also 6/4 (from 5/4) that Liverpool open the scoring and 3/1 that the game ends 0-0.


FT: That's it! And WHAT A ROAR around the John Smith's Stadium!
They're in absolute dreamland as they hand United their first Premier League defeat of the season. An extraordinary afternoon in West Yorkshire.
This is Huddersfield's day, and to a man they were fabulous. They played with an extra central midfield player, and David Wagner has played a blinder.

90+4: Valencia cross; blocked. But then it falls to the back post to Smalling! 
CLOSE! He takes a touch, looks for the bottom corner, but Zanka dives in brilliantly to block! Match-saving tackle!!

90+4: Into the last minute here.  United on the ball.

90+2: Heroic defending by Schindler! United look to break, but the defender throws himself in front of two through balls and Huddersfield survive.

90+1: Four minutes added on here! Not sure where that's come from.  there's only been one sub!

90: Van la Parra has chased everything, and nearly catches De Gea out there. De Gea rushes out, doesn't get enough on it, but the Huddersfield man is on the floor and can't claw it goalwards! United recover.

88: Mkhitaryan tries a drilled diagonal for Rashford on the right of the box, but it's yards ahead of him and goes out of play!

87: Lossl is a little bit fortunate there. Young's deep cross is fumbled by the goalkeeper, Lukaku is under him and doesn't do much wrong, but Mason gives Huddersfield the free-kick. 

86: Corner to United from Tom Ince's miscued clearance. Young takes low, Herrera with a little flick, but Mounie claws it away!


84: Rashford looks to return the favour to Lukaku, but his drilled cross from the right is picked up by Lossl. 
The ball then bobbles away from Lingard as he looked to penetrate the Huddersfield defence. It hasn't been his day so far, Lingard.

82: Young with a looping cross from the left, but it's in the air too long, Lukaku is shrugged away by Schindler and Huddersfield survive. 

80: Yellow card for Williams after a needless foul on Young. Huddersfield have gone very, very deep now. 
But Mooy pinches it off Lukaku, and the hosts can breathe  

GAME ON! It's the sub Rashford who gets United back into the game with a back-post header.
It's fine work by Lukaku on the right, getting to the byline, turning and sticking in a nice deep cross. Zanka gets caught under it, but Rashford's header into the ground beats Lossl. 
Twelve minutes to get another!

76: SAVE! Best chance of the game for United! Herrera glances on a header at the near post from Young's nice cross, and Lossl makes a superb save to his left!

74: Eye of the needle stuff for United. Huddersfield are defending the width of their 18-yard box, and United are having to go so, so narrow to make any sort of inroads. 

72: CLOSE! Nearly an opening for United. Rashford plays a central ball into Lukaku's path, he has to stretch for it with Schindler all over him, but he can't get a firm enough touch on the ball and Lossl collects gratefully. 

70: Change for Huddersfield as the rain comes pouring down in west Yorkshire. Depoitre come off, Mounie is on. 

68: It's a good job Huddersfield aren't in the Carabao Cup this midweek. They'd be absolutely exhausted. A supreme, energetic performance from David Wagner's men. 

66: A bit end-to-end now. Huddersfield battle down the right, Van la Parra's cross just finds Depoitre with his back to goal, but he can't turn and shoot!
At the other end, Lingard breaks, but his through ball looking for Rashford is poor, and Zanka cuts it out. 

64: Mkhitaryan breaks free on the right of the box, but he's offside! Mourinho looks cold and very unhappy on the sideline. 

United are out to 12/1 for an unlikely turnaround here with Rashford 7/1 to score next and Lukaku 9/2 in the same market.

62: Young is booked for a trip on Van la Parra, who has been superb since coming on. Free-kick, in a crossing position on the right. Mooy is over it.
Mooy takes, it's cleared to Van la Parra on the edge, but his shot is blocked and the visitors just about clear.

61: Free-kick to United on the left. Rashford takes, and Huddersfield play the offside trap. Only one player is offside, at the back post, and Herrera at the near post turns the ball wide! Half chance.

59: Oh dear. Rashford leaves Smith for dead on the left, and has plenty of time to get a decent cross in.  but on his weaker left foot, he miscues it out of play. 

57: Lindelof is screaming at Ashley Young, raising four fingers up. I think he's trying to tell Young they are playing a back four, as Young has been high up the pitch looking to get United back into this game.

55: SHOT! Young has more time than he realises here, on his left foot in a central position 25 yards out, but he flashes it well, well wide of the left-hand post. 

54: Lingard takes a United corner, but Lossl punches away, then Mooy clears the second ball. Huge cheer every time Huddersfield clear their lines, and rightly so. 

52: Right pass by Van la Parra down the right for Smith, but he's just overcooked it and it goes out of play. Constant noise from the home supporters here.

50: No real flow to this second half as yet. Neither side getting their foot on the ball.

48: Lindelof looks very unsure of himself. Depoitre bullies him on the right flank, and he gives away a throw. 

46: Back underway here, and two United changes.
Mata is off, so too is Martial, Rashford and Mkhitaryan come on. That's all of Mourinho's subs used by the start of the second half!


HT: That's the half! Two mistakes by United, two Huddersfield goals, but that doesn't tell the real story.
United haven't created a clear chance, and that's all down to Huddersfield's superb pressing on the ball. They've taken the only two chances they've got in the game, too. 

45+2: CHANCE! Late pressure from United with a couple corners, but both are cleared. The second is back into the box, it falls to Matic, and his shot is deflected just wide of the left-hand post!

45: Or maybe more?
Depoitre does superbly to win a corner, Mooy takes, it's flicked to the penalty spot, but Valencia turns it away. 

44: Van La Parra gets Huddersfield 50 yards up the pitch with some superb running. He wins a free-kick, and the hosts look to be going into the break two goals up.

42: Great pressure on the ball from Huddersfield, particularly on Matic to prevent his quarter-back style passes into central positions. 

40: Huddersfield's turn to be forced into a save. Kachunga has a back problem, and is replaced by Van la Parra. 

38: PENALTY APPEAL! Nothing given, but a big shout by United. Kachunga's momentum takes him into Herrera on the edge, and I've seen those given. Herrera is fuming.

36: United are shellshocked. Matic sticks a hopeful ball over the top, but it doesn't reach Lingard as Zanka clears.

Oh dear, oh dear. Lindelof, having just come on for Jones, is at fault here.
It's a long, long ball forward from the Huddersfield goalkeeper Lossl, Lindelof is under it but almost ducks his head as the ball comes to him, allowing Depoitre to race onto it behind him. He rounds De Gea, and slots it into the empty net!
Unbelievable start by the hosts here!

34: United have reverted to type, as have Huddersfield. All the possession is with the visitors, but they're failing to make inroads into the box. 

United are out to a potentially generous 6/4 having gone a goal down, with Huddersfield into 2/1 for what would be a famous win.

32: Two quick corners for United after going behind, but both are cleared well. 
Goalscorer Mooy is very late on Herrera in midfield, and somehow escapes a booking.

30: Great tenacity from Mooy, great running from Ince to support, but the criticism will be laid on Juan Mata. He lost out far too easily there.

What a noise! Huddersfield are ahead!
Aaron Mooy puts pressure on Mata in midfield, as Huddersfield have done for the entire first half, and the Spaniard loses out easily.
Mooy races forward, feeds Ince in the area, his turn and shot is blocked by De Gea, but it falls to Mooy 10 yards out. He finds the right corner, cue jubilation int he stands!

25: Lindelof replaces Jones. Real blow for United, I wonder if Jose Mourinho will mention it after the game?

24: Bad news for United. Phil Jones being Phil Jones, he looks to have tweaked his groin while battling near the corner flag. He's been superb so far this afternoon.
Lindelof being readied on the sideline.

22: Young makes room for the cross on the left with a trademark twist and turn.  Lukaku tries a scissor kick under pressure from Zanka, and it's well wide. United on top here.


That's it! Neither side showed enough endeavour to create that opening for a winner, and the spoils are shared. Obiang's audacious attempt stands out as the game's highlight. Was Foster fortunate to stay on the pitch? Highlights on there way, you decide!

94: Does that count as a shot? Obiang lines up the cross, but it is far too close to Foster, who gathers.

92: Chance for Cresswell to cross again, but yes, you guessed it, he failed to beat the first man.

90: Five minutes of added time.

89: Can anyone find a winner here? It doesn't look likely, but one can only hope.

87: Arnautovic whips a great cross into the middle, but Hegazi does really well to clear. That was dangerous. 

85: Another straight swap for Albion, with Allan Nyom coming on in place of Gibbs.

83: Late lunge from McClean earns him a yellow card. Free-kick to West Ham in a good position. 

81: Carroll's afternoon is over, as on comes star of Transfer Deadline Day Diafra Sakho.

79: McClean has the chance to get the ball into the dangerzone this time, but he slices the ball out of play. One mistake could decide this. 

77: Cresswell again has the chance to get the ball into the middle, but once more the delivery is poor. Tale of the afternoon.

75: One change apiece. Phillips is replaced by James McClean while Hernandez's afternoon is over, as Andre Ayew takes his place.

73: Obiang lines up another effort, this time from much closer in, but he gets well underneath it and the ball ends up in row Z.


71: Change for West Brom and it is Brunt's number that's up, as he is replaced by Hal Robson-Kanu.

69: West Brom can't get near the ball here. All West Ham. That incident seems to have riled them.

67: West Ham players and coaching staff are still remonstrating with the officials. The rules have changed in terms of punishments for goalkeepers, but that tackle was high, and dangerous. Foster's sheepish look tells its own story. 

Soccer Saturday's Matt Le Tissier is in no doubt the ref got that wrong.
"If an outfield player makes that challenge it's a red card. The tackle is dangerous and Foster is a lucky boy to still be on this pitch."

65: DRAMA! Foster comes charging out of his goal, slides in, takes out Hernandez, with a high foot, but is only cautioned. He is a lucky, lucky boy. Very dangerous. Bilic is furious on the touchline.

63: The Hammers try to kick the ball out, but Krychowiak gets in the way, and plays on. The visitors are furious, but the Baggies were well within their rights to play on.

61: Really slow pace to the game. It is almost as if the home side don't want to win this. It is no wonder they struggle for goals on their own patch.

59: Change of shape for West Ham now, who have reverted to a flat back four. They look the most likely winner here.

57: That's the end of the game for Collins, who did well to last this long. Marko Arnautovic takes his place.

55: Hernandez comes deep to try and influence proceedings, but he is no use to the Hammers there, and just gets in the way!

53: Great cross from Cresswell is just too short for Carroll, and the ball is cleared. The hosts have to show more here.

51: Ball is lumped forward towards Antonio, but he is never getting that and the ball runs out for a throw.

49: All Hammers at the start of the half here. West Brom can't get out of their own half. 

47: CLOSE! Jose Fonte gets up really well to meet Cresswell's corner, but glances his header wide.

45: KICK OFF! We are back under way here at the Hawthorns. No changes for either side. 



45+2: That's your lot for the first half. A game of few chances so far, except one, stunning effort from Obiang. Would have been a contender for Goal of the Season if it had gone in from 45 yards, but the crossbar denied the midfielder. The hosts have been sloppy on the ball and created very little.

45: Two added minutes here at the end of the half. 

44: Break in play as Collins receives some treatment. The West Ham bench look very worried indeed.

42: Better possession from the visitors. Mainly in their own half, but they are retaining the ball very well. 

40: Evans shows great feet to beat his man, footwork Pep Guardiola would be interested in, goes to ground, but referee Tierney waves away appeals for a free-kick. 

38: CHANCE! Best opening for the Baggies. Phillips again with good work to get to the byline, his clipped cross is perfect for Morrison, but he fails to connect with a header. Had to do better. 

36: Long ball into the middle lands on the head of Carroll again, but he is swamped by defenders, and the ball is diverted out for a corner. 

34: Hammers really growing into this now. All the attacking is being done by them at the moment.

32: Carroll does well to bring the ball down out of the air, but is always leaning back as he volleys well over the top. 

30: The Hawthorns is still in shock here. In a game of such low quality, that effort stood out like a sore thumb. Absolutely incredible. 

28: WHAT AN EFFORT! From just inside the West Brom half, fully 45 yards, Obiang spots Foster off his line, goes for it, beats the England stopper, but sees his strike cannon back off the crossbar. What a goal that would have been!

26: SHOT ON TARGET! Tremendous work from Antonio to win the ball back, beat his man, and then fire at goal. Easy save for Foster, but brilliant attitude from Antonio. 

24: Phillips remains the hosts' main threat on the counter. However, time and again he is having to turn back, with no options ahead of him. 

22: Sloppy from the home side. The slippery surface isn't helping the flow, as the Baggies give the ball away time and again. 

20: Michail Antonio tries to take the attack to the Baggies himself, beats two men, but overruns it and the ball goes out for a goal-kick. 

18: Still all the possession with the home side here. They are really struggling to create any meaningful openings, however. 

16: Again, the delivery from Cresswell is really poor, as his free-kick this time fails to beat the first man. 

14: Good pace to the game here. The Baggies starting to get on the ball much more, but West Ham remain a threat on the break.


FT: Second-half
goals from Richarlison and Etienne Capoue have handed Watford a deserved 2-0 win
over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium this afternoon.
Richarlison,
signed from Fluminense in the summer, made the breakthrough after 73 minutes,
the Brazilian scoring on his full debut for his new team.
And the visitors
wrapped up the points late on when substitute Capoue scored a screamer from
long range to hand new manager Marco Silva his first-ever away win in the
Premier League.
As a result,
Watford have got off the mark this season thanks to their first league win since
April 1, but the Cherries have begun the campaign with two straight losses and
no goals scored either.

90+3: A late corner for the home side, but again the Watford back line easily deal with the threat.

90+1: And there will be an additional SIX minutes to pay on the south coast.

90+1: SUB! A final change for Watord as Watson comes on for Chalobah as we enter stoppage time at the Vitality.

WHAT A GOAL! Game over at the Vitality as after Begovic had beaten clear Gray's stinging shot at his near post, the ball fell nicely to Capoue some 30 yards out and the substitute thumps a low shot past a helpless Cherries 'keeper.

82: SUB! Watford bring on Kabasele for Amrabat for the closing stages.

81: CHANCE! Pugh escapes to the left-hand byline and the sub's cross is then deflected nicely into the path of King, whose close-range header just loops over the bar.

80: SUB! Watford goalscorer Richarlison is forced off with cramp, to be replaced by Capoue.

78: SUB! A last throw of the dice for the hosts as Mousset comes on for Fraser.

77: Gray has been outstanding playing through the middle as a lone front man this afternoon with his pace and power.

75: So Bournemouth have only a quarter of an hour left to draw level..

Watford's pressure finally tells as Chalobah feeds Gray down the right side of the area and his pull back is then bundled home at the near post by Richarlison for his first goal for the club after Begovic made a mess of trying to get to the centre.

71: CHANCE! Speaking of Richarlison, the Brazilian goes on a mazy run down the left, before cutting inside and unleashing a shot on goal that Cook somehow manages to block with his outstretched legs.


PIC! Richarlison has been Watford's best player so far at the Vitality..

68: SHOT! Another Watford corner from the left reaches Richarlison at the near post, but his shot is cleared from near the goal line by Arter.
Am not sure the Brazilian's effort was on target though..

67: A good spell of pressure this now from Watford as they earn a left-wing corner, but Bournemouth's defence hold firm to clear the danger.

65: SAVE! Another quick break by Watford sees Gray race through down the right of the area, but his shot is easily beaten clear by Begovic at his near post.

63: YELLOW! Chalobah now picks up a booking for a late tackle on King.

62: CHANCE! A chance for Chalobah to at least test Begovic from outside the box, but the midfielder's effort is off target.

60: SUB! Pugh now replaces the disappointing Ibe.

59: SUB! A huge ovation rings round the Vitality as Defoe comes on for Afobe.

58: YELLOWS! Gray gets booked for protesting to the referee for not awarding Watford a free kick in that move just now, with the striker clearly taken out by Cook - who also got booked - as he tried to keep up with Chalobah.


57: WHAT A CHANCE! Chalobah races clean through one on one with Begovic, but the midfielder cannot beat the Cherries 'keeper - will the visitors have a better chance today?

55: Cheeky that from Arter, who called to Chalobah to dummy the ball as Watford broke, and the Hornets midfielder did as well, much to his opponent's fury when he realised what had happened! A bit unsporting that.

53: More Bournemouth pressure as another corner is swung in from the left, but this one evades everyone in the middle.

51: A much better start to the half by the hosts, although that has also left them a little bit more exposed at the back to a Watford counter as they push more men forward.

49: A half chance for the Hornets as the ball drops invitingly to Amrabat in the box, but the midfielder drags his effort well wide of the far post.

47: SAVE! Bournemouth win an early corner, swung in from the left, but Cook's header lacks the power to really trouble Gomes.

46: OK we are back underway after half-time at the Vitality, with Bournemouth re-starting the game playing from let to right in the second half.


HT: Referee East blows his whistle to bring an end to the first period at the Vitality and let's just say it has been a half to forget folks!!
But do not go anywhere as the second 45 minutes can only get better, surely... !

45+2: CHANCE! What a chance for Watford to open the scoring after a neat turn in the box by Richarlison, only for Gray to side-foot over the bar from six yards out after the Brazilian had picked him out.

45: We are now into first-half stoppage time folks..

43: So it looks like we are going to go in all square at the break, which is a fair reflection on the first 45 minutes.

40: A good battle in the box between Afobe and Britos, with the home side wanting a corner, bur Mr East points for a goal kick.

38: Watford earn a rare corner, from the left, but it is headed well over the bar at the near post by Richarlison.

36: Finally, Ibe - who has now switched flanks to the left - takes on Femenia and beats him for pace, only for Prodl to be in the right place at the right time to clear the danger.

34: There is no doubt that both teams appear to be cancelling each other out at present.

32: However, Bournemouth's resulting corner from the right is overhit and Watford can clear their lines.

31: SAVE! A simple long ball over the top releases Afobe, who holds off Britos, only for Gomes to keep his mis-hit shot out at the near post.

PIC! New signing Gray has been a busy presence up front for Watford so far in this first half.

27: YELLOW! Britos picks up the first booking of the game after following through late on Arter.

25: A slight worry as Smith and Richarlison tumble to the floor after a nasty-looking clash of heads, although I think they will both be OK to carry on..


23: Halfway through this opening period and as yet, we are still awaiting our first real good chance of the game.

PIC! Watford midfielder Chalobah has made an impressive start to the game at the Vitality.

19: CHANCE! Good move by Watford as Amrabat swings a cross in from the right, but despite rising highest, that man Chalobah cannot direct his far-post header on target.

17: A chance for Chalobah to get free in the box and maybe get a shot off, but the midfielder is needlessly offside and the move comes to an end.






"I would have taken him off before the booking," Alan Pardew told Sky Sports. "Then it is
unacceptable to make the challenge he did on a booking. I can’t imagine what
Pochettino thinks of that.
Redknapp added: "Trippier must be sitting on the bench and thinking, ‘I’m
going to be playing every week.’ He had a blinder [because Aurier was poor].

"They have the best centre-forward in the country by a mile," Jamie Redknapp said of Harry Kane. 
"He makes the game look so easy and he was the difference on the day."

"I’m delighted to get a couple of goals and help the team get
the three points," Kane said.
"We just have to improve our home form and we should be right
up there. We’ve had a couple of good away wins from tough games."

West Ham: Hart
(6), Cresswell (6), Fonte (6), Ogbonna (6), Reid (6), Zabaleta (6), Kouyate
(6), Noble (6), Antonio (n/a), Arnautovic (6), Hernandez (7)
Subs used: Carroll (7), Ayew (5),
Masuaku (6).
Tottenham: Lloris
(6), Aurier (4), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7), Sanchez (6), Davies (7),
Dier (7), Sissoko (6), Alli (7), Eriksen (8), Kane (8)
Subs used: Winks
(5), Trippier (5), Llorente (n/a)
Man of the match: Harry Kane

Spurs survive a late scare to take the three points! They were cruising 3-0 up before Aurier's red card but West Ham couldn't grab the equaliser after goals from Hernandez and Kouyate brought them back into it.
That's Tottenham's fifth consecutive away league win stretching back to last season.

90+5: There's a flare up as Reid clashes with Llorente and all the players are getting involved, Hernandez isn't happy with something. Michael Oliver just needs to calm this down.
YELLOW! Llorente and Carroll are booked - Dier may have seen yellow there too. Lots of cards late one here.

90+4: YELLOW! Ayew goes flying into Davies and he's in the book. Time all but up.

90+3: Carroll throws himself at the delivery but he's a little under the ball and can't direct his header goalward. Carroll says he was shoved by Sanchez but Michael Oliver isn't interested.

90+2: Carroll fires on goal from the edge of the box and it's cleared for a corner. A big roar from the home crowd.

90: FOUR minutes of added time.

89: SUB! Kane is withdrawn, replaced by Fernando Llorente.

West Ham are well and truly back in it! A brilliant cross from Masuaku picks out Kouyate and the midfielder buries his header past Lloris. Unstoppable.
Spurs face a nervy few minutes. This game was in the bag with just over 20 minutes to play.

85: It's floated towards the back post, Carroll looks to tee up Reid but misjudges his lay-off. It's not been a good performance from Carroll since his first-half introduction for the injured Antonio.

84: Ayew wins a free-kick in a good position after drawing Davies into the challenge. This could be one for the left-footed Cresswell.

81: YELLOW! Hernandez lunges in a little wildly on Dier and it's a booking. Time is running out for West Ham to make their man advantage count.

79: NO PENALTY! Hernandez wants handball after the ball pops up and hits a Tottenham defender on the arm. Michael Oliver is not interested. 
The ball breaks back to Hernandez anyway and Lloris beats away his snap-shot. West Ham are knocking on the door.

77: SUB! Another Tottenham change and it will be Trippier to replace Sissoko, who was playing right-wing back after Aurier's red card.

74: SUB! Fonte is replaced by Masuaku.

73: SUB! Harry Winks is introduced for Eriksen. Pochettino looking to close things up after going down to 10 men.

70: RED CARD FOR AURIER! The full-back picks up his second booking and he walks! It was a pointless lunge on Carroll - a definite booking.
As Jamie Redknapp said at half-time, he's been something of a liability.

68: CHANCE! Can West Ham grab another?! They are giving it a go. Noble whips in a delicious cross for an unmarked Hernandez but the Mexican's firm header is straight at Lloris.

66: SUB! An immediate response to the goal from Bilic, who brings on Ayew for Arnautovic.

Lifeline for West Ham!
Fonte flicks on a corner and Hernandez is in the right place at the right time to nod home from close range.
About as textbook a Javier Hernandez goal you could see. A poacher supreme.

64: YELLOW! Aurier is in the book after his latest foul. One of several.

64: POST! Kane close to a hat-trick again! He stands up Reid and beats him to the left, firing a low shot from a narrow angle that rattles the post and hits Hart, earning a corner.
That comes to nothing, though. Kane has been brilliant this afternoon.

That should be game over!
Kane hits the post with a low free-kick from the left and the ball comes out to Aurier, whose deflected cross then breaks to Eriksen inside the area.
The attacker shows great composure to guide his first-time finish into the bottom corner. No chance for Hart.

59: West Ham have to be careful not to get frustrated here. Fonte takes out Alli and concedes a free-kick in the left channel. The visitors have weathered that Hammers pressure and are back on top now.

56: NO PENALTY! Eriksen carries forward for Tottenham, picking out Kane, who shuffles the ball on to Sissoko. The Frenchman slides a nice pass into the box for Alli, who tries to turn sharply past Reid and Zabaleta.
The Spurs man goes down as Reid dangles a leg and wants a penalty but Michael Oliver is not interested. It would have been soft.


54: It's been a decent start to the second half from West Ham, who are just enjoying their best spell of the match. Spurs are pinned back but you sense this will suit them - they can be devastating on the counter.

50: The Hammers waste the delivery and Spurs break through Alli. The England international takes a heavy touch with Zabaleta to beat - he had Aurier on the overlap too - and the chance goes for the visitors. A missed opportunity.

49: Sloppy play by Eriksen as he needlessly tugs back Noble towards the corner flag and West Ham have a free-kick in a promising position.

48: A hopeful long ball from Reid somehow releases Arnautovic in behind Aurier but the Austrian's first touch is awful, allowing the Spurs man to recover.
The Tottenham summer signing looks a little lost defensively at the moment.

46: We are back under way for the second half - any way back for the Hammers? Let's find out.

Jamie Redknapp just had this to say on Serge Aurier's first-half display.
"Aurier has been a liability for Spurs. Arnautovic has got
after him and he’s looked very rash - he could have conceded two penalties. He’s been the only problem for Tottenham
in an otherwise controlled performance."


A difficult first-half for West Ham, who lost Michail Antonio to injury and then conceded two quick goals to Harry Kane. They face a tough task to turn this around.

45: TWO minutes of added time.

45: Hart sticks on his line and Davies nearly latches onto Alli's clipped ball forward but Zabaleta recovers well to clear the danger for the hosts. Spurs are looking for a third before the break.

44: West Ham look a little shell-shocked after that quickfire Kane double. They were well in the game until the striker's intervention. 


Tottenham have a second and it's another for Kane! He can't stop scoring!
Vertonghen does well down the left and slips a pass into Alli, who tries to flick his finish past the onrushing Hart.
The West Ham goalkeeper does well to save Alli's effort but the ball breaks kindly for Kane to roll into an empty net.

Spurs punish a loose pass by Carroll to take the lead.
Carroll's poor pass inside his own half goes straight to Eriksen, who immediately releases Alli.
He gets his head up well and has an unmarked Kane streaking through the middle, giving the striker a simple headed finish with a firm cross.
Ruthless from the visitors.

32: Noble steams into Sissoko and the Frenchman is not happy with the challenge. Michael Oliver, who had actually awarded West Ham a free-kick for a tackle on Hernandez just before, speaks to both players.
That's brought the home crowd to life.

32: No goals and few chances to speak of so far at the London Stadium.


That concludes our coverage from an
incident-packed Premier League clash at the Etihad. Be sure to keep across all
the reaction on the Sky Sports platforms. Thanks for joining
us!

And Patrick Davison caught up with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola after his side put Liverpool to the sword.

We've brought you Jurgen Klopp's quotes following Liverpool's hammering at Manchester City, but now you can watch the German's full interview with Sky Sports' Patrick Davison.

Kevin de Bruyne
also claimed Sadio Mane was slightly unfortunate to see red.
The Sky Sports’ Man
of the Match said: "It's not a bad foul, but with the way Eddy comes out
of it, it's normal for a red card. If he doesn't have that injury it's probably
yellow."

Pep Guardiola
has described Sadio Mane’s collision with Ederson as “huge”, but stopped short
of declaring it worthy of a red card.
“In this kind of action, Mane didn’t see Ederson and was
looking at the ball, but the impact was huge,” he told Sky Sports.
“I don’t know if it was a red card but what I am sure
about is that Kyle Walker’s red against Everton was not.”

Man City: Ederson
(7), Walker (6), Stones (7), Otamendi (5), Mendy (6), Danilo (6), Fernandinho
(7), D. Silva (7), De Bruyne (9), Jesus (8), Aguero (8).
Subs: Bravo
(6), Mangala (6), Sane (7).
Liverpool: Mignolet
(6), Alexander-Arnold (5), Klavan (6), Matip (6), Moreno (6), Henderson (7),
Wijnaldum (6), Can (6), Salah (6), Mane (5), Firmino (6).
Subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain
(6), Milner (6), Solanke (6).
Man of the
match: Kevin De Bruyne

The decision to send Sadio Mane off has certainly split
opinion, and Jurgen Klopp is in the
camp that the Liverpool forward was unfortunate.
"I don't
think it's a red card, he didn't see him,” the Reds boss told Sky Sports. “I saw the goalie already
and obviously it's not that bad. In the first moment everyone thought it was
really bad.
"It was
unlucky, it was an accident. The goalkeeper comes out, Sadio wants the ball. To
get a red card in a game like this is really unlucky."


Having been given another 45 minutes to reflect on Sadio
Mane’s red card, Jamie Carragher was
adamant referee Jon Moss made the right call.
“Very few red cards are because a players wants to do another
player. I’ve done bad challenges and they are reckless and mis-timed. Mane isn’t
thinking about hurting the goalkeeper, he’s so focused on the ball.
“But that’s not the point, it was reckless and dangerous
and that’s the rules and that’s why it’s a red card.”

Sky Sports co-commentator
Gary Neville named Kevin de Bruyne
as today’s Man of the Match.
"He was
absolutely fantastic. In the big moments in the game, the first goal, it's a
wonderful, wonderful pass.
"And then
the second goal, in my opinion it's the biggest moment in the game other than
the sending off in terms of taking the game away from Liverpool.
“The goal wasn't
down to Liverpool being down to 10 men because they had bodies in the box, it
was just a brilliant cross."

Jamie Carragher
reflects on the heaviest defeat of Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool tenure.
“Liverpool were only a man down defensively, so we
shouldn’t have seen what we saw there, conceding four goals. I understand why
Klopp went to a back three but it didn’t work, Can didn't look comfortable in
a back three.
"Liverpool were poor second half but City are the one team in the
Premier League you do not want to go down to 10 men against because they’ve got
the players to absolutely destroy you.”


Here's what City's emphatic victory does to the Premier League standings.

The full-time whistle sounds at the Etihad to bring an end to a miserable afternoon for Liverpool. Manchester City put the Merseysiders to the sword with four unanswered goals following Sadio Mane's first-half dismissal.

Sensational! Leroy Sane saves the best goal until last, whipping an unstoppable left-footed effort that flashes past Mignolet into the top corner. What a goal that was!

90: Into TWO minutes of added time at the Etihad.

87: SAVE! Mignolet is on hand to prevent City grabbing a fifth. The Reds stopper leaps across his goal-line to deny Aguero from slotting Sane's cross into the back of the net.

85: Sane receives a stern word from the referee after coming through the back of Moreno to get the ball. He did win the ball but took a chunk of the Liverpool full-back at the same time.

83: Can makes a hash of clearing Fernandinho's pass, which was intended for Aguero, and Aguero pounces. He pushes the ball around the Liverpool midfielder but the angle is too wide to test Mignolet as his shot sails over.

81: City are unable to deepen Liverpool's misery even further as De Bruyne - for the first time this afternoon - plays an aimless cross into the area which is cleared. 

80: YELLOW! Frustration beginning to set in for Liverpool as Can is booked for catching Aguero with a late challenge.

It gets worse for Liverpool as City grab their fourth. Mendy has been at the forefront of City's attack in recent minutes and he finally finds that killer pass, picking out Sane whose first-time finish flashes past Mignolet at his near post.

74: Mendy has been given licence to bomb forward down the left and he doesn't need a second invitation, delivering two low crosses into the Liverpool area which Aguero is just unable to meet.

72: CLOSE! Mendy whips a cross into the Liverpool area which Matip almost turns beyond his own 'keeper, but Mignolet pulls off a fine near-post save.

71: SUB! Third and final change for City as Eliaquim Mangala replaces Nicolas Otamendi.

70: Alexander-Arnold whips the free-kick into the City area but it's cleared before it finds a red shirt.


69: Solanke does well toward off the interest of two City defenders before releasing Milner, who draws a foul from Danilo on the right wing.

67: SUB! Third and final change for Liverpool as Roberto Firmino makes way for Dominic Solanke. You can understand Jurgen Klopp's logic with this game now surely beyond his team.  

65: CHANCE! Fernandinho slots a great pass through to find sane on the left wing. He cuts it back for De Bruyne, who had checked his run in the area, but his finished leaves much to be desired, sailing high over the bar.

Here's an update on Ederson's condition from our reporter Patrick Davison.
"After initially being assessed at the stadium, Ederson’s not
gone to hospital but the Manchester institute of health and performance near
the stadium. He’s being checked for possible cheek and jawbone fractures."

62: City, understandably, with all of the possession as they search for a way through a Liverpool side who, after the addition of Milner, are battening down the hatches.

58: SUB! Second change for Liverpool as James Milner comes on against his former club, replacing Georginio Wijnaldum.

57: SUB! He's not happy about it but Gabriel Jesus makes way for Leroy Sane. Perhaps Guardiola has an eye on a congested September for City.

56: City work a lovely short corner which releases Mendy in behind, but his driven cross is gathered by Mignolet.

City do get their third as Fernandinho releases Aguero and the Argentine unselfishly squares for his team-mate to convert past the isolated Mignolet. Bordering on embarrassing for Liverpool now.

53: DISALLOWED GOAL! City have have a second goal ruled out for offside as Aguero's toe-poke is chalked off.

50: Oxlade-Chamberain floats a nice ball over the City defence, releasing Firmino momentarily before Stones turns the ball behind for a corner. Even with 10 men, Liverpool are still able to ask questions of this City defence.

48: Liverpool look to have shuffled their pack in light of Mane's dismissal. The visitors are now set up in a back three, with Alexander-Arnold and Moreno as wing-backs. Oxlade-Chamberlain slots into midfield and Firmino is the loan man up top.

HALF-TIME SUB! Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain makes his Liverpool debut, coming on for Mohamed Salah.

KICK-OFF! City get the second half underway!

Despite his allegiances with Liverpool, Jamie Carragher was left in no doubt the decision to send Sadio Mane off was the right one.
“It’s a red card. I didn’t think it was initially, I
needed a lot of replays, but the boot in face says it all. Initially, I thought
Mane made contact with Ederson’s chest but he didn’t. Yes, Mane’s eyes were on
the ball but it doesn’t matter, he still endangered an opponent.”



The half-time whistle sounds at the Etihad and Liverpool, despite making such a bright start, have an absolute mountain to climb after Sadio Mane's straight red. City were shaky at the start but took the lead through Aguero, with Jesus doubling their tally against the 10 men from Merseyside. Jurgen Klopp's unbeaten run league run against Manchester City looks to be coming to an end.

45+8: Salah sprints clear down the right flank, skipping over De Bruyne's rash challenge, but City manage to dispossess the Liverpool winger before he has the chance to reduce the arrears.

City do have their second and it's all down to De Bruyne again as he puts the ball on a plate for Jesus, who, having just been denied by the offside flag, heads beyond Mignolet from close range.

45+3: GOAL DISALLOWED! Jesus wheels away in celebration after beating Mignolet to a superb De Bruyne cross, but the flag correctly goes up for offside, with the Brazilian a yard beyond the last man.

45+1: Into EIGHT minutes of added time.


Highlights coming your way at 5.15pm on your mobile.  Don't go anywhere. 

FT: And there's the full-time whistle. A historic start for contrasting reasons at the Liberty Stadium.
Watford make it three top-flight away wins in a row for the first time in their history, while Swansea lose their third successive league game at home. The agony at the Liberty continues for the Swans.

90+4: Deeney takes it to the corner, Watford looking to run down the clock.

90+2: FIVE minutes added on. Any way back for the Swans? 

And it's Richarlison who will steal the headlines! 
Roque Mesa tries to be too clever and his pass ricochets off Deeney and falls for Richarlison, who storms towards Mawson.
Somehow the ball evades the Swansea defender and Richarlison bears down on goal and smashes it in off the bar.

89: Tense times at the Liberty. Both teams are going for it which is great to see, can anyone steal the headlines? 

87: The corner doesn't beat the first man! And Swansea clear.  but Deeney then wins the ball back to start another Watford attack.
SAVE! Pereyra's cross is then laid off for Deeney, but he can't quite whip it past Fabianski, who makes a smart save.

85: Before it's taken, Bony comes off and here comes Renato Sanches!
Watford make a change too as Troy Deeney is on for Gray. Could the Watford club captain make an immediate impact?

84: Naughton all over Richarlison in the edge of the box but this time Lee Mason isn't interest... but Watford do have a corner.

82: And it is Carroll, but he cannot get it up and over the wall. 'Handball!' cry the home fans, but Richarlison's arms were clutched against his chest. Meanwhile, Bony goes in the book for a late tackle.

81: Abraham buys a free-kick just outside the box... minimal contact, if any, and there are a few Swansea players queuing up to take this one.

Here's Abraham, CELEBRATING his equaliser. Perhaps a sign of his frustration having started on the bench? 

77: Cleverley with a cross in and it appears to come off Gray last, but Watford have a corner. Swansea clear the danger momentarily, and a lazy offside then hands the hosts possession.

75: Second change for Watford, and it's the impressive Carrillo who comes off for Roberto Pereyra. Saying that, Carrillo, like most of Watford's attack, had little to shout about this half.

73: Hefty, but fair, challenge from Naughton and Holebas stays down. Mason urges the player back up which is good to see, and play goes on! 


69: Another dangerous free-kick in from Carroll but Watford just about hook it clear. Little over 20 minutes to go and this game is anyone's for the taking. Swans on top, mind. 

67: Swansea win a corner and Kabasele is waved back onto the pitch... Carroll, of course, is standing over this one.  but Doucoure heads it straight back out for another corner. Take two for Carroll, and there is Kabasele of all people to head it away from danger.

65: CLOSE! Ayew plays a sumptuous ball out wide for Carroll, who takes his time to send in a cross. He picks out Bony but Kabasele bravely flies in before Mariappa blocks Abraham's effort.
Referee Lee Mason is then forced to stop play as Kabasele stays down with a head injury. No arguments really for the Swans, that was some gutsy defending.

62: Now it's time for Silva to look at his options and consider how they can stem the Swansea onslaught and repeat their first-half efforts. All Swansea, the hosts need to capitalise on this momentum.

60: The murmurs of discontent have well and truly gone at the Liberty. The Swans are in the ascendancy now, having had almost 70% of possession so far this half.


Was just about to say how the mood has lifted at the Liberty, and now they have a first home goal to celebrate this season!
The cross comes in and Bony can't quite connect with it, but he gets a second chance and forces a fine save from Gomes.  but Abraham is there to tap in the rebound.

55: Another wicked delivery in from Carroll and it earns Swansea a corner. Carroll with another opportunity to send one in.
OVER! The cross finds Fer, whose header appears to come off Kabasele but no subsequent corner is given.

53: OUCH! This one looks very nasty. Richarlison clutches his hand and is in absolute agony. Replays show that after he falls to ground, Ayew accidentally stamps on his wrist. Nothing intentional there, and thankfully the Watford man looks like he'll be okay to continue. 

51: Clement barking instructions from the technical area. He will be desperate to see his side capitalise on this bright start to the half. 

49: Different role for Ayew as he drops back a bit - he wins a free-kick for the Swans but they choose to play it round instead of pumping one into the box. Swansea on top so far this half. 

47: So three new faces as we enter the second half. It makes sense for Swansea to mix things up and Abraham's first touch is a positive one. It also has an impact on the home fans, who are lifted by the youngster's presence. 

Second half underway!
DOUBLE SUB! Tammy Abraham and Roque Mesa come on for Swansea, Clucas and Van der Hoorn make way. Change of shape, will Swansea see a change in fortunes?
Watford meanwhile bring on Molla Wague for Capoue, who was on a yellow card.


HT: Carroll finding his range with his deliveries and Swansea now have a corner just before half-time.  but no! Lee Mason blows his whistle and that is the end of the half. Frustration for Swansea, who trail to Andre Gray's first goal for Watford. 

45: Carrillo fashions a chance from nothing and Watford have a corner.  It's a dangerous ball in and Capoue almost picks up a loose ball but it's out for a goal-kick.
ONE minute of added time as Doucoure goes into the book for pulling back Fer.

44: WIDE! How has Bony sent this one beyond the far post?
It's a terrific cross from Carroll, and Bony has a free header from eight yards out but he can't quite connect with it properly. Let off for the visitors. Chances aplenty now.

42: JUST WIDE! So, so sloppy from Swansea. A terrible throw-in from Olsson bounces awkwardly for Mawson, he then brings it down and it's a terrible back pass from the defender, as Gray nips in to steal the ball, but he's at a narrow angle and glances his effort just wide of the far post. 

40: Swansea go close again but it doesn't result in a shot on target. Olsson's cross almost finds Bony, but the ball ricochets off a couple of Watford defenders before making its way back kindly for Gomes. 

38: Yet again, boos ring around the Liberty as they are forced to play it backwards. Mawson makes his point by urging more movement from the players up front. Frustration at boiling point in south Wales. 

36: Another chance for Swansea to send one into the box. Carroll whips one in, Fernandez picks up the loose ball and plays it out wide for Naughton, whose awkward ball towards the back post is smothered by Gomes.

34: Heavy challenge from Capoue sees his name go into the book. Carroll's delivery into the box is not good enough though and Watford clear the danger. 

32: DISALLOWED GOAL! And boy are Swansea lucky. They're all over the place at the back as Carrillo sends in a cross. It falls to Holebas whose volley from 25 yards out is parried by Fabianski straight to Richarlison, who plays it over for Carrillo to tap in, but he's offside and the goal won't count.
Correct call too, about a yard off or so.

29: Now whistles from the home fans as Gomes bides his time before taking a goal-kick, could be a long afternoon for the Swansea faithful. 

27: Groans from the home fans as they lose possession cheaply. They're replaced by ripples of applause as Renato Sanches heads out to warm up for the hosts. Unlikely to be a sub before half-time, but a change in personnel would certainly help the hosts. 

A first goal for Watford, and this is what it means for Andre Gray.

22: Almost midway through the half and the hosts have certainly upped their game since going a goal down. Slightly frustrating for the home fans though, to see that it takes a goal to wake them up.


20: WIDE! A free-kick for Swansea finds Bony, but his header from about 15 yards out sails wide of the near post.

17: BIG CHANCE! Swansea have responded superbly since going a goal down and they really should be level. The cross comes in and Fer's header glances across goal and Fernandez is unable to tuck it away at the back post.


It's a first Watford goal for Andre Gray!
And it's Bony who gives the ball away to begin with for the Swans - Watford go on the counter and Gray plays it wide for Carrillo, whose cross is intercepted by Clucas, but it falls kindly for Gray who smashes it home.

12: A lot of long balls forward from Swansea not finding their intended target so far. That target is indeed Bony, but he is being beaten in the air by one of Mariappa or Kabasele as it stands. 
This time a Clucas ball forward does find Bony though, who lays off Ayew, but his attempted scoop to return the favour can only find Gomes.

Right, that's a wrap for this evening. Thanks as ever for your company and do keep an eye out for reaction to United's win on our platforms from Gary Neville and Thierry Henry.
Oh, and there's also more football to come this evening on Sky Football as well.
Bye for now.

Alan Pardew gives his reaction to Manchester United's rampant performance against West Ham...

“I have years and years of experience. My feet are on the
ground. I’m calm.”
And Jose leaves the building. Stay tuned to more reaction from him on our digital platforms. 

"Real Madrid [Super Cup] was too early for him. It’s not easy
coming to the Premier League. Ricardo Carvalho – one of the best defenders in
this league and it was difficult for him to adapt. Victor needs a little bit of
time. We’ll give him that time. Let’s go, step-by-step."

Were you surprised Chelsea allowed him to move?
“It depends on what was happening behind the doors [at Chelsea]. I bought
him to Stamford Bridge years ago as he has special qualities. I always thought
he’d be a perfect player for us. I never thought it was possible – until his agent
told me he could have him, you just have to pay. He’s a player our team needs.” 

"Many times last season we deserved to win and we didn’t. We
deserved to win today. The confidence levels are really high. It wasn’t perfect
– we made mistakes. We have room for improvement. It was a solid performance. I
liked the attitude. We tried to score more goals." 

Jose Mourinho is in the Manchester United media suite – let’s
see what he’s got to say….

Let's hear from Lukaku after he netted twice on his Premier League debut for Manchester United.

Bilic has touched down in the Manchester United media
centre. Here are the key bits from his press conference:
“It shouldn’t affect confidence but it will. We have an obligation
to pick ourselves up.”
“They were much better than us. Better with and without the
ball. They had the quality and pace. We wanted to avoid one-on-one situations,
but struggled.”
On the injury front, he reported that Michail Antonio will
return next weekend against Southampton. 

Here are the thoughts of West Ham boss Slaven Bilic.

"We didn’t start especially
well, maybe we were a bit nervous, but then we had a quality performance, with good
personality and a word which I like – 'confidence'. The team played with lots of
confidence and even at 2-0 they were confident and kept playing football.
"I was
happy and it was a very positive performance.
"The fact we start with a win
and are top of the league means nothing. Last season we were top after the
first match so it means nothing. The level of performance means something to
me. 
"We lost two points against West Ham last season here and had lots of
similar matches where we were dominant but didn’t score enough goals, today we
did and we got three important points."

Gary Neville: "I still can’t believe Chelsea
let him go. I thought he was outstanding and did everything really well. He was
better on the ball than I’ve seen before and his passing was good. I can't think of one reason why Chelsea sold him."
Graeme Souness: "I played as a
holding midfielder and he is arguably the best around at the moment. He was
filling spaces and on the ball he is top-notch quality. He is a great athlete
and has all the attributes to be a top midfielder."


"You wouldn’t want to play
against this side now, whereas 18 months ago they didn’t hurt you and it was
boring to watch.
"The problems they had last
season were in this type of game where they couldn’t break teams down, but they
look powerful and strong, and it was a good win to start the season."


Romelu Lukaku on Sky Sports: "To play in front of such a crowd and for such a
great club is a dream come true, but the win was the most important thing. It’s
joy for the team, everybody has a job and mine is to score goals. 
"Everybody
created a lot of chances and we scored a lot of goals, so it’s promising. It’s
just the start, we need to keep working and following the manager’s plan."

Who stood out for United aside from Lukaku? How about Matic?
The midfielder won possession more times than any of his team-mates (11), played more passes (69), had more touches (89) and got involved in more duels (19).
Overall a very solid display.

Can't argue with this.

Well how's that for a statement of intent? A thumping win for Manchester United. Their biggest victory since September 2014.
Lukaku scored twice on his Premier League debut for United and Martial and Pogba added gloss to the scoreline late on.

And here's the fourth from Pogba.

90: Three minutes to be added on.

This opening-day win gets even more emphatic. Again West Ham are cut apart as the ball is played down the middle for Pogba.
He could probably play in his good friend Lukaku but instead goes for goal from around 20 yards and curls it beyond Hart.
United heading to the top of the Premier League after the opening weekend.

88: That assist is Mkhitaryan's last action as he is replaced by Lingard.

Clinical from Manchester United. Played into the feet of Mkhitaryan, who slips through a brilliant first-time pass for Martial to run on to and then finish past Hart.

87: Almost an opening for West Ham as Hernandez steals the ball from Lukaku and plays it through for Sakho. The pass is overhit though.

85: United have looked very comfortable in defence. No sign of a late West Ham fightback at the moment either.

82: Zabaleta has had a difficult game, first up against Rashford and now Martial. He can't stop Martial as he runs down the left before checking back and then chipping in a cross which Lukaku can't stretch to reach.
Might have been offside if he had got it anyway.

81: West Ham make their final substitution as Cresswell comes on for Masuaku.

79: Another switch for United, with Rashford replaced by Martial. A very lively display from Rashford, particularly in the second half.

77: CHANCE! Decent opening for West Ham as a cross gets through to Arnautovic at the back post. He decides to shoot, rather than look for team-mates in the middle, and blazes it way over the bar.

75: First change for United as Mata is replaced by Fellaini.

73: Thierry Henry has been analysing the second United goal and has seen Masuaku appearing to have a chuckle about something as he marked Lukaku in the box.
"You cannot defend like this,
I know you are playing in the Theatre of Dreams but you cannot day dream
like that," says Henry.
Gary Neville is not impressed either, saying it was "shocking, rubbish, pathetic from a
defender". 

71: CLOSE! Valencia gets in space down the right and lofts up a cross to the back post where Blind smacks a volley into the ground and it bounces over the bar.

70: Lovely skill from Pogba - who has been excellent today - as he skips away from two challenges on the right side of the box. He gets penalised for a slight tug on Zabaleta though. 

67: Ogbonna was booked for a foul on Matic in the build-up to that Rashford chance.

66: OFF THE POST! What an effort from Rashford.
He skips forward and then checks inside Zabaleta before drilling a shot across goal from the edge of the box that strikes the far post and flies across the line.

64: SHOT! Another United opportunity as Pogba slides the ball inside the box for Rashford, but he fires a first-time shot way over.

62: CHANCE! Nearly the hat-trick for Lukaku.
Rashford starts the move, breaking down the left and then playing it across the box for Mkhitaryan. He slides it on for Lukaku, whose shot is well blocked by a sliding Zabaleta.


61: CLOSE! Almost an instant impact from Sakho as he meets a corner, but he doesn't make a good contact on the header and ends up glancing it across goal rather than towards it.

61: Double change for West Ham. It's Fernandes off for Sakho and Noble off for Rice.

60: Valencia goes in late on Arnautovic on the touchline and earns himself a booking.

59: OFF THE BAR! A chance from nothing for West Ham as Fernandes clips a ball into the box, where Arnautovic gets the wrong side of Blind and heads towards goal.
It goes over De Gea but clips the top of the bar and goes behind.

57: Rashford plays it across the middle for Mkhitaryan to tap in, but Rashford was offside in the build-up so the goal won't count.

56: Long, long way back for West Ham now. And they need to show a lot more going forward if they are going to get back into this game. United have been completely dominant.

A second for United, and a second for Lukaku. It's simple enough as Mkhitaryan clips in a free-kick from the left and Lukaku gets ahead of his marker to glance in from eight yards out.
Not good defending from Masuaku to allow the striker to get ahead of him so easily, and Lukaku's brilliant record against West Ham gets even better.

52: Rashford again on the run and this time he knocks the ball past Zabaleta outside the box on the left and wins a free-kick. Also a yellow card to Zabaleta, who blocked off Rashford's run.

50: CHANCE! Good pace from Rashford, but he can't finish.
He races clear away from Reid down the left side, gets into the box and then opens himself up to finish in the far corner, but he shoots over the bar.

47: Zabaleta wins a free-kick on the right touchline after being fouled by Rashford. It's swung in by Arnautovic but headed clear. Not the best delivery.

No changes at the break and it's West Ham to get the game restarted.


It's all over at the bet365 Stadium! Chelsea maintain their 100 per cent away record with a resounding victory, sealed by Alvaro Morata's hat-trick a Pedro's fine first-half strike. Stay tuned for highlights from 5.15pm.

90: There will be THREE minutes of added time.

89: YELLOW! Crouch goes in high on Fabregas and picks up a yellow card. He's lucky not to have seen red there.

88: OFF THE LINE! Kante saunters forward before finding Moses in space on the right. The wing-back then drills a low cross into the area which Morata tries to bundle home, but Johnson is there to clear off the goal-line.

87: CLOSE! Morata is a whisker away from getting his fourth as he runs on to a Fabregas through pass but flashes a shot wide at the near post.

85: Champagne football from Chelsea as the fresh legs of Fabregas and Hazard pile the pressure on this makeshift Stoke defence. I wouldn't be surprised if was saw more goals here - the champions are in the mood!

Sheer class from Chelsea as Alvaro Morata seals his hat-trick. Fabregas floats a delightful ball over the stationary Stoke defence which Azpilicueta chests into the path of Morata, and he pokes home his third.

80: CLOSE! Chelsea so close to a fourth as Moses plays in Hazard and he tries to set up Morata for a tap-in at the back post, but Stoke manage to clear in the nick of time.

Simply superb from Alvaro Morata! Johnson gives away possession on halfway and he is ruthless punished as the Spaniard carries the ball all the way into the area before finishing past Butland. Game, set and match Chelsea.

76: SUB! Second change for Stoke as Ibrahim Afellay replaces Martins Indi - their only recognised defender. Now this is a gamble, will it pay off for Mark Hughes?

72: CHANCE! How on earth have Stoke not scored? Shaqiri picks Fletcher out in the six-yard box with a fine delivery but, with the goal gaping, he somehow fails to make contact before Martins Indi drills the ball into the side-netting. 

71: CLOSE! Shaqiri plays a delightful reverse pass that releases Allen through on goal. He looks set to get a shot away, but Bakayoko intervenes at the last moment with a fine challenge.
71: SUB! Eden Hazard comes on for Willian.

68: SUB! Courtois has been given the OK to continue, but that doesn't stop Antonio Conte making a second change as Pedro makes way for Fabregas.

66: Concern on the Chelsea bench as Courtois lands awkwardly on his back/neck after punching a corner clear.

65: NO PENALTY! Choupo-Moting escapes Moses and Cahill on the left before being brought to ground by Cahill in the penalty area, but referee Dean is having none of it. It's a tough call for the referee, especially with Cahill making contact while on the ground. It's one which both sides have a case.

64: CHANCE! Crouch makes a nuisance of himself, beating Cahill to the ball in the air and knocking it down for Diouf, who steals a march on Rudiger but fires over.


61: SUB! First change for Stoke as Peter Crouch replaces the ineffective Jese.

60: Cahill is involved immediately, heading a Shaqiri free-kick clear. Chelsea try and break through Willian but the ball finds its way back to Shaqiri, who cuts inside onto his left foot and draws Courtois into a save.

58: SUB! Marcos Alonso has been hooked by Antonio Conte before he sees red, with Gary Cahill coming on for the final half hour or so.

57: YELLOW! Ramadan Sobhi breaks on the counter for Stoke but he is quickly brought to ground by Kante, who picks up a booking for his troubles.

56: Chelsea hit back with a couple of chance sin quick succession, the last of which sees Butland pluck a cross out of the air before it reaches Morata.

54: CHANCE! Chelsea clear the resulting free-kick as far as Allen, who volleys over the bar from 18 yards.

53: NO YELLOW! Alonso has lost his head and is incredibly lucky not to see a second yellow as he clatters into the back of Diouf. Referee Mike Dean gives the wing-back a stern talking to, as does his captain Azpilicueta. Stoke fans are aggrieved with decision.

52: YELLOW! Not the greatest 60 seconds for Marcos Alonso, who is booked for a clumsy foul on Allen.

51: Alonso goes to ground clutching his face after an aerial duel with Diouf. Stoke put the ball out of play and Alonso immediately springs to his feet, much to the annoyance of the home faithful.

50: Morata races in behind Martins Indi but his cut-back takes a deflection on it's way through to Butland.

49: YELLOW! Shaqiri picks up the games first booking. Not quite sure what that was for, one can only assume it was for dissent.

47: Johnson bursts forward from the back and tries to pick out Choupo-Moting at the back post, but Azpilicueta is alert to the danger as Choupo-Moting prevents a goal kick by hooking it out for a throw.

KICK-OFF! Both sides as they were before the interval as Chelsea
get the second half underway at the bet365 Stadium!



So far, so good for Chelsea. In front inside 80 seconds thanks to Alvaro Morata's opener and two to the good thanks to Pedro's fine second. Stoke, who have been bright going forward, will feel aggrieved to be two goals down, but you cannot afford to make the mistakes they have against the champions.

45+1: There will be ONE minute of added time at the bet365 Stadium.

45: Choupo-Moting's cross is cleared as far as Allen, who controls on his chest but fires a volley high over the target.

42: CLOSE! Stoke pile on the pressure before the interval but are yet to reduce the arrears as Fletcher sees a low effort blocked en-route to goal before Diouf's acrobatic overhead kick whistles wide.

40: Pieters gives away possession in Chelsea territory and the Blues race forward on the counter. Willian is again the instigator, carrying the ball with intent, but his cross-field pass for Moses is cut out by Pieters, who makes amends.

38: CHANCE! Choupo-Moting does brilliantly to chase a lost cause and win a corner. Shaqiri whips a fine delivery into the area where it falls for Choupo-Moting, but he's unable to turn it goalwards. 

37: Chelsea patiently go in search of a second, with every outfield player having a touch of the ball. The move ends with a Pedro trying to latch onto a lofted pass, but there's too much pace on the ball and Butland ushers it out for a goal kick.

34: Shaqiri strikes the ball perfectly and it looks set to find the top right-hand corner of Courtois' goal, but the Chelsea wall does its job, deflecting it behind for a corner which comes to nothing.

33: Stoke with an early chance to respond as Bakayoko is penalised for barging Allen to ground on the edge of the area. Shaqiri to take.

Chelsea two to the good as Pedro pounces on Fletcher's under-hit back pass, races through and fires an unstoppable curling effort into the bottom corner. It's harsh on Stoke but you simply cannot afford to much those kind of errors against the champions.

28: Moses plays a high ball up to Morata who, under pressure from both Martins-Indi and Pieters, manages to win a throw-in deep in Stoke territory.

27: Morata holds up play nicely on halfway, spinning on receipt of the ball and luring Allen into a foul.

25: Stoke fans up in arms as Moses is adjudged to have kept the ball in play in the right-hand touchline, but their team soon deal with the situation as Willian's cross is cut out by Pieters.

23: Willian leads a Chelsea attack but is dispossessed as soon as he gets to the Stoke area. To make matters worse, he is then penalised for a trip on Martins Indi, easing the pressure on the hosts.


21: Moses plays a hopeful ball up field which Pedro chases. The Spaniard then puts Johnson under pressure to deal with it, and the Stoke defender rises to the challenge, fashion a yard of space before clearing his lines.

19: Azpilicueta plays another good pass up to Morata, who is quickly shoved off the ball by Martins Indi. Morata appeals for a free-kick but the officials deem the challenge legal.


FT: Well, there we have it. Late heartbreak for Swansea as they concede another late winner. Diafra Sakho was West Ham's hero with the goal.


90: We've got five minutes of added time.

Finally a goal and it's Diafra Sakho with it! Masuaku bursts down the left, he drives past Naughton and plays a lethal ball across the goalmouth. Sakho is there at the back post to tap in and possibly hands West Ham victory!

85: OFF THE WOODWORK! Carroll surges into the box and meets Kouyate's low cross, but his first-time shot ricochets off the bar!

83: West Ham are playing more long balls into the box but they're still struggling to break the Swansea defence down as Carroll is adjudged to have fouled Mawson, who has done an excellent job matching Carroll aerially.

77: SUBS! Chicharito and Ayew come off for Masuaku and Sakho.


72: Lanzini turns his man and crosses to the far post looking for Carroll, but Fabianski is there once again to make the catch.

70: It's been a scrappy half with neither side able to create any real significant chances. West Ham have looked the livelier team but you feel somebody needs to take this game by the scruff of the neck.


65: Fabianski looks in some discomfort despite receiving treatment but he's going to play on.

64: NASTY! Fabianski and Carroll clatter into each other after going for a high ball. The medical staff are coming on now to treat the Poland international.


62: Zabaleta pumps a ball into the box which Carroll nods down looking for Ayew but the ball goes too far away and Fabianski collects.

61: SUB! Lanzini comes on for Mark Noble.

59: This game is lacking spark.. will Manuel Lanzini be the man to provide it? He's preparing to come on for West Ham.  

56: Sanches takes the free-kick but his effort is awful. It goes high and wide and is met with jeers from the West Ham support. 

55: ANOTHER YELLOW! This time for Carroll, who cynically trips up a surging Abraham. Swansea free-kick.

54: YELLOW! For Kouyate as he poorly slides into Sanches. A deserved booking. The following free-kick comes to nothing.

52: SO CLOSE! A great ball into the box by Antonio goes to the far post. Carroll slides in but he can't quite reach the ball as one touch would have sent it past Fabianski and into the net! Carroll was unlucky there.

50: West Ham win a corner off Sanches. Cresswell floats one in for Carroll but Abraham does just enough to get in the way.

48: YELLOW! For Britton after he pulls back Chicharito as he tries to break forward.

47: Olsson swings in a cross which Reid poorly slices clear behind for a corner. The set-piece comes to nothing.

46: And we're back underway! Leroy Fer has come on for Wilfried Bony.

The Soccer Saturday Price Boost is currently 7/1 at half-time, with Manchester United two goals to the good but Leicester and West Ham level.
Back the Soccer Saturday Price Boost here.



45: One minute of added time in this first half. 

42: Cresswell's low ball into the box looking for Hernandez is cleared behind by Fernandez. West Ham corner.
43: Cresswell plays the out-swinger but Ayew heads away the danger. The ball back in is thumped clear by Mawson.


40: Bony nearly plays in Abraham for a one-on-one but Fonte makes the crucial interception.

39: Sanches' cross into the box goes over the head of Abraham in front of goal and the frustration shows on the Swansea striker's face. Sloppy from Swansea.

37: SAVE! Carroll plays a low cross into the box which Ayew gets down low to connect with, he flicks his header towards goal but the deflected attempt is claimed by Fabianski.



32: West Ham are really finding it hard to keep the ball for more than a few seconds, but Swansea haven't done enough to capitalise with all their possession. 
Olsson's whipped cross into the box is met by nobody.

29: YELLOW! A few handbags come out as both teams argue over Sanches' late tackle on Cresswell. 
It's a poor challenge from the Portugal international and he's lucky to not pick up more than just a yellow card as he puts in a high challenge on the fullback.

28: Plenty of loose passes in this match summed up by Joe Hart's poor goal-kick which goes out for a throw-in. The West Ham fans aren't best pleased at what they're seeing right now.

26: Abraham tries to volley Fonte's loose header but its blocked by the West Ham defender. Swansea continuing to apply the pressure.


24: Swansea win a free-kick near West Ham's corner flag. A needless foul from Kouyate on Ayew.



20: West Ham try to counter-attack through Antonio down the right flank but Britton does well to sweep up and force him out of play, much to the delight of the away support.

17: Play has been stopped as Kouyate is down receiving treatment following a collision. 
He's now up and has gone off to the sideline.

14: SHOT! From Carroll following some good hold-up work by Hernandez. He tees Carroll up but his strike bobbles into the hands of Fabianski.
15: GREAT SAVE! At the other end, Bony finds space from outside the box and drives a shot towards goal from distance, but Hart strongly punches clear.

12: Sanches wins Swansea a free-kick in the West Ham half as Cresswell chops hims down. 
Swansea opt to pass it around the back instead of playing a ball forward. Clement's side have been relatively timid when they've been in attacking positions.

10: Some good industry from Carroll on the right flank as he tries to battle his way into the box but Olsson blocks him out.


That's it, Huddersfield weather the late Southampton pressure and the match ends goalless.
The hosts are still unbeaten in the Premier League after three games, as are Southampton.

90+2: Redmond wins a free-kick deep inside the Huddersfield half. Ward-Prowse to swing it in.
Romeu nods it wide but was offside anyway.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

90: OFF THE LINE! Bertrand should score at the death! Long chips up a perfect cross to the far post and Bertrand is unmarked. He keeps his header down but doesn't get the right direction on it, allowing Smith to hack it away.

88: SUB! Kachunga is replaced by Quaner for the final minutes.

86: OFFSIDE! McQueen is slipped in down the left channel and squares for Yoshida, who volleys wide from point-blank range. Fortunately for the Japan international, the flag was already raised. It would not have counted.

85: SAVE! Another chance for Southampton! Long gets away down the right and picks out Redmond on the edge of the box. The winger takes a touch to steady himself and tries to find the top corner but Lossl is across to palm it away.

82: NO PENALTY! A great ball by Long releases Ward-Prowse on the counter. He's away but hasn't got the pace and checks back onto his left foot but goes down under the challenge of Jorgensen in the box. The referee doesn't give it, Ward-Prowse can't believe it. A let off for the hosts.

81: We are inside the final 10 minutes now. One goal probably wins this game and at the moment, you would say Huddersfield are favourites to get it.

78: That sums it up for Southampton in these last 20 minutes. They finally get a bit of possession in the Huddersfield half but Redmond sends his pass straight out of play. They look a spent force in attack.

76: CHANCE! Yoshida is robbed by Ince and the ball breaks to Palmer but Stephens blocks the shot from the edge of the area. Southampton are hanging on a little bit.
Williams heads the resulting corner well over the bar. He couldn't get over it.


75: Huddersfield are coming on strong now, with Palmer bringing real energy to their play. He charges down a Stephens clearance.
SUB! Final change for Southampton as McQueen replaces Tadic.

73: They need a few attempts to get Mooy's free-kick clear but Southampton eventually manage, Davis first and then Ward-Prowse.

72: A needless foul by Redmond on Smith towards the corner flag gives Huddersfield a chance to swing a cross into the box.

70: SUB! Gabbiadini is withdrawn, replaced by James Ward-Prowse.

68: CHANCE! Huddersfield keep the ball alive in the box and a desperate block by Yoshida denies Mooy. Southampton felt there was a foul on Bertrand by Kachunga in the build-up but nothing given. Huddersfield on top now.

68: Nothing comes of the Huddersfield counter. We are just coming up to the final 20 minutes. Will we get a winner?

67: A succession of Southampton corners keeps the pressure on the hosts, with Lossl spilling one. His defenders bail him out, though, and Huddersfield can break.

65: SUB! First change for Southampton as Lemina is taken off. Shane Long comes on to support Gabbiadini.

62: SUB! Another change for the hosts as Billing is replaced by Williams.

60: Still no breakthrough at the John Smith's.

57: CHANCE! Smith whips in a lovely cross for Mounie, who gets above Stephens but can't plant his header on goal. It is well over the bar.

56: SUB! Van La Parra has not been able to shake off that shoulder problem. He is replaced by Kasey Palmer.

53: It's been a bright start to the second half for Southampton, who were largely second best for the first 45 minutes.

51: CHANCE! First opportunity for Gabbiadini! Lemina turns a neat pass around the corner for the Italian, who takes a heavy touch, but he still gets his shot away from the edge of the box. It's straight at Lossl, who gathers. 
Gabbiadini just picked up a knock in the process of shooting but he is trying to run it off.

50: Van La Parra is fine to continue for Huddersfield. It's been a very stop-start beginning to this second half.

49: Soares fouls van La Parra and we have another stoppage. The winger landed awkwardly on his shoulder and needs treatment.

48: Smith takes the ball to the face and needs a moment to recover so we have a brief stoppage.
But we are swiftly under way again. Southampton will surely want to get Gabbiadini more involved. He barely had a kick in the first half.

46: We are back under way for the second half.



All square at the break but plenty of chances. Huddersfield have been on the front foot and created opportunities but the best opening fell to Redmond, who curled wide when one-on-one with Lossl.

45+1: YELLOW! Romeu leads with his arm challenging Mounie for a header and Huddersfield win a free-kick.

45: ONE minute of added time.

43: Romeu stays down after a crunching 50-50 with Billing in midfield and Huddersfield put the ball out. The Spaniard looks fine to continue, though.

42: We've seen very little of
Gabbiadini or Redmond so far. Southampton are struggling to work play up to the forwards,
Huddersfield well on top at the moment.

40: CHANCE! Forster makes a terrible mess of a swinging cross, fumbling the ball straight into the path of Kachunga. To the goalkeeper's credit he recovers to smother the shot but that was awful keeping initially.

39: Southampton will just want to settle again after a blitz of attacking by Huddersfield. The hosts are launching crosses into the box at every opportunity and several of them have been very high quality deliveries.

36: SAVE! A hopeful ball over the top deceives Yoshida and Ince latches onto it. He still has plenty to do from a narrow angle but forces a stop from Forster, who unconvincingly claws it away.
The resulting corner is initially cleared by Southampton but Huddersfield regain possession and keep the pressure on.

36: SAVE! Huddersfield work another short corner before Mooy delivers deep to the far post. Mounie bullies Romeu and rises above the Spaniard, but Forster is behind the striker's header.

33: Mooy wriggles away from Redmond but Romeu brings him down. The Huddersfield playmaker will take the free-kick himself, but it's poor and Bertrand clears at the near post.

31: WIDE! Mooy spreads the play well with a long pass to the right. Smith overlaps Ince and his low cross finds Mounie 10 yards out. The striker doesn't catch his shot cleanly but it still nearly finds the net, bobbling inches past the post. Forster probably just about had it covered.

29: SHOT! Lemina tries his luck with an ambitious 35-yard strike and it's well wide of Lossl's left-hand post.

26: Both teams playing well in the early stages. The game is being played at a frantic tempo.

23: BLOCK! Huddersfield break from the Southampton corner as Lossl gets the ball out early. The low cross in from the right from Ince picks out an unmarked van La Parra but Davis blocks the shot. That looked to be heading in.

22: Southampton break at pace as Redmond releases Davis and he wins a corner from Lowe. Good tracking by the left-back.
Bertrand takes for the Saints but it's too deep and Lossl gathers easily.

21: The home crowd is making plenty of noise, especially after those two big chances in quick succession. It's a very good game so far, both teams have had excellent opportunities.

19: CHANCES! Two big opportunities for Huddersfield! The first comes from van La Parra, who plays a low ball in and a brilliant block by Yoshida denies Kachunga.
The second is a super save by Forster as he keeps out Mounie's first-time finish after an excellent cross by Billing.


FT: Three points are three points, it doesn't matter how you get them! A poor match comes to an end and Newcastle have stole the win at St James' Park! Mikel Merino is the hero, as his 86th minute header is enough to win it for the hosts. Palace were arguably the better side but they didn't record a single shot on target.  Newcastle woke up late on, and got the all-important winner in fortuitous circumstances.
Stay here for highlights from 5.15pm.

90+3: Dann pushes Yedlin and Newcastle are edging towards a slender victory.  One minute to go.

90+2: Poor from Townsend when Palace need to get the ball into the box. He gets his cross all wrong and it's out for a goal-kick.
No surprise to see Elliot take his time with this one.

90: FOUR minutes added on.  

88: It's the luckiest of ways to open your account, but Merino will not care. Two minutes plus stoppage time to hold onto this one.

Finally, the deadlock has been broken!
It's Ritchie with the corner and it's actually headed by McArthur against the head of Merino, which in turn sends the ball beyond Speroni. It's his first goal for Newcastle, and first since June 2016.

85: Ritchie with the ball in and Sakho gets an important head onto the ball. Now Yedlin sends in a cross but Dann heads clear. Now Newcastle have another corner.  

84: The ball ricochets off PVA and Newcastle have only their second corner of the game.  It's a short one and Atsu's cross is blocked, but Ritchie gets another cross in which is this time headed away by Dann. 

82: This game has livened up a bit. Rather late in the day but there's still time for someone to steal the headlines.

80: Newcastle need a hero as we enter the final 10 minutes.  and on comes Mitrovic! The Serbian replaces Joselu. Can he find a winner for the hosts?
CHANCE!! Loftus-Cheek is played through and at a narrow angle his shot-cross trickles across goal and Van Aanholt cannot get to it in time.

78: Wow. So close for Newcastle, but Sakho does well to clear calmly in his own six-yard box. The fans have woken up and that's because their side are in the ascendancy! 
WHACK! Atsu absolutely leathers one and it smacks Dann on the side of the face. The Palace defender remains down and needs some attention, but thankfully he hasn't been knocked out by that one. That was some hit. 

77: Now a first Palace sub.  Zaha looks disappointed to be heading off, and he's right to feel aggrieved, with Loftus-Cheek on to replace him.
Zaha has been Palace's greatest outlet along with Townsend. Strange decision, but could come up trumps. 

75: SAVE! Second shot on target alert! Signs of life in this game, I repeat, there are signs of life.
It's Shelvey from distance and Speroni struggles with this one, attempting to catch it but palming it high into the air. Fortunately for the Palace keeper it bounces to safety and they get it away.

73: SAVE! First shot on target alert!!!
Diame receives the ball just outside the area, he turns onto his right foot and looks to curl one in, but Speroni flies over to make a comfortable save.

71: Joselu is probably a lucky boy not to get a second yellow here. It's a late challenge on McArthur, and the Newcastle forward probably benefits from the fact that the Palace midfielder got straight back up. 

69: Free-kick for Newcastle and it's a decent chance for Shelvey to pick someone out, but he overcooks the cross and it bounces out for a goal-kick. This game has just nothing going for it right now, but with the rain starting to tumble down, will a mistake happen moreso than a moment of magic?

67: Second change for Newcastle as Mo Diame comes on for Perez.
And now it's Joselu who goes in the book for a tackle on Cabaye.

65: JUST OVER! Merino this time guilty of giving the ball away and Cabaye picks out Townsend, who carries the ball before cutting onto his left. He cannot keep his effort down though and it's over Elliot and the bar too.


63: It's another Palace corner and Cabaye heads over to receive more jeers and whistles. Soaking up the stick as he's clearly in no rush.
His cross finds Dann but the knockdown cannot find a Palace player. 

61: Manquillo is the fifth player to go into the referee's book for a poor challenge on McArthur.
Groans again from the home fans as Perez can't control the ball with Newcastle on the attack. The hosts still have it though, but Atsu's cross is out for a goal-kick.

59: WHEY! Cry the Newcastle fans, with Van Aanholt running through unchallenged before scuffing his attempt. It's so bad it's almost out for a throw-in, but just about rolls out for a goal-kick. Terrible attempt. 

57: Again Newcastle lose the ball and Palace earn themselves a corner. Whistles for Cabaye, who smiles as he goes over to take it.
It's headed away though, but it remains Palace in the ascendancy.

56: Rafa blinks first and makes a much-needed change. Mikel Merino comes on to replace Hayden. Can the former Osasuna and Dortmund man spark some life into this tie?

55: Newcastle lose the ball again and Zaha does well to cut inside and find Townsend, who returns it to Zaha. His low ball in almost finds Schlupp but it rolls through for Elliot. 

53: Home fans just starting to get restless. They're being made to watch a Palace side boss the game currently. Newcastle have shown very little by way of attacking threat. 

51: Palace on the attack and it's a decent ball from Sakho through for Van Aanholt, who shoots wide of the far post. Offside flag goes up though, tight call, right call.

49: Half starts as quietly as the first one did. Which manager will make the first amendment? Newcastle in particular are lacking a spark. 

47: Gareth Southgate, Sting and Jimmy Nail watching on. Will they be treated to a better half this time around? 

Second half underway at St James' Park.  

Lascelles was not too happy with Cabaye's challenge on Yedlin. The Frenchman escaped with a yellow.


HT: Stuart Atwell brings the half to an end. The biggest decision he had to make was whether to give former Newcastle man Cabaye his marching orders for a tackle on Yedlin. He opted for a yellow and it remains 11v11, while it also remains goalless. Palace on top as the half went on, but they're still searching for that first away goal of the season! 

45: There will be TWO minutes added on at St James' Park.  

44: Now it's Zaha's turn to bring down Yedlin. Shelvey pumps one into the box but it just doesn't fall kindly for Lascelles. Sakho then clears the danger for Palace.

42: More flying tackles than chances this half. Four players on a yellow already. Could be lucky to see 11v11 come full-time.

39: JUST WIDE! Best chance of the game so far and it falls for Palace.
Great work from Townsend down the right and his cross stands it up perfectly for Zaha at the back post, but he can only steer his header wide of the mark. All Palace at the mo!

37: Zaha goes down under Yedlin's challenge. The hosts aren't too happy but it is a foul.  Cabaye to take, McArthur looks destined to nod this one in but Joselu comes flying in to head out for a corner.
NO PENALTY! Corner comes in and it falls kindly for Cabaye, whose volley comes off Shelvey's chest, not arm.
Shelvey then clears Townsend's corner and Newcastle can breath again!

35: SIDE NETTING! One of those that gets one half of the stadium excited.  Atsu out-muscles Ward and storms into the box, his shot is just wide of the near post. Would have done well to score from there.

33: In the aftermath of that Cabaye tackle it appears Lascelles was handed a yellow too for his push on Cabaye after. Moments later Van Aanholt also gets his name into the referee's book. 

31: Replay of that Zaha no penalty incident... The Palace winger twists and turns past Shelvey and goes down under no pressure..  However, Zaha does not appeal himself and actually is disappointed with the way he tumbled down, as if he had stayed on his feet he could have got an attempt away. 


29: The Newcastle fans are up in a rage as Cabaye goes in hard on Yedlin. It's a dangerous challenge and the Frenchman immediately puts his hands up to say sorry as the home crowd make their feelings known.
Stuart Atwell takes an age before getting a card out, but it's only a yellow. Close call that - if an orange card existed.

27: Perez plays it over for Ritchie, who opts to place it instead of lace it and his effort deflects wide for a first Newcastle corner.
Ritchie goes over to take but McArthur heads away.
NO PENALTY! Palace go on the counter, Zaha goes down but the referee says no. Dive? Perhaps

25: WIDE! Palace have certainly grown into this game and they're on top at the moment.  Schlupp runs through unchallenged but at a narrow angle he sends his effort wide of the far post. 

23: Cabaye is complaining to referee Stuart Atwell as he accuses Shelvey of going in too hard on Sakho. It was a meaty challenge where he was happy to get ball and man, but not worthy of a booking. Good challenge in fact.
SAVE! Cross comes through to Zaha at the back post, he cuts onto his right and his low cross-shot is saved by Elliot.

21: YELLOW! Relatively early booking for Lejeune, who trips up Townsend after the Palace winger turns him (nutmegs him) and attempts to dart towards the box... Chance to cross one in.  bit it's Yedlin who heads clear!

19: Newcastle just edging possession at the moment, but very few chances to report. None of target after 19 minutes.

17: BLOCKED! Newcastle fail to create an opening from a free-kick in a decent spot and Palace go on the counter. One former Toon man, Townsend, bursts down the pitch and finds fellow ex-Newcastle man Cabaye, who sees his effort from the edge of the area blocked.

Ok then. That is a wrap for tonight, and a wrap for matchday four in the Premier League. It won't be long until we are back, though, with plenty more top-flight action coming up on Sky Sports.
See you again soon.

And here are the thoughts of West Ham boss Slaven Bilic.

Here's what David Wagner had to say to Sky Sports.



Here's Andy Carroll reflecting on his positive return to the West Ham side.

Some tough games coming up for the Terriers.

No beating around the bush from Huddersfield boss David Wagner.
"We were not good enough. It was a deserved result. We were
second best in more or less every area. With the ball we were not good enough. We
looked like a promotion teams with some nerves. We made so many unforced errors."


Some
revealing words from West Ham boss Slaven Bilic, who acknowledged he was under pressure
before the game.
"It was a must-win game
and I was pleased with the way we played. It was a top performance and we
totally deserved it.
"I have felt the pressure for a
whole year now. Although for me it’s not logical to be under pressure after
three games, but that’s modern football. But we kept calm and changed the shape
a little and said we were going to get back to basics.
"I said last year that our
performances in the second part of last season at home were improved and we
played some really good games here. We are feeling the stadium is now like our
proper home. It will never be Upton Park, but it's becoming our home more and
more.
"It's my birthday and this
is a great present."


Huddersfield's Tommy Smith on Sky Sports: "We weren’t quite at it today. The manager stressed at
half-time that we weren’t brave enough with the ball and that showed. We are
very disappointed.
"I don’t think on the whole we were as good as we can be.
"We will dust ourselves down and look forward to the game
against Leicester on Saturday."

Sam Alllardyce on MNF: "For Slaven that has taken
the pressure of him. He has got the three points on the board and can push on
and the players who come back will strengthen the squad.
"They can be a force going forward and have lots of goals in the team, it's just about being solid at the back and getting clean sheets."

Andy Carroll on Sky Sports: "It was very important. We had a tough run, we needed the three
points and the clean sheet. The fans were great, we needed a big boost and the
fans came out roaring and were behind us all the way.
"The team is a great team. The gaffer has bought some great players in and when everybody is fit it's going to be a battle to get into the team."

Plenty still to come on Monday Night Football.

The win moves West Ham off the bottom of the Premier League table. Huddersfield stay sixth. They'd probably have taken that after four matches.

It's all over. A first win of the season for West Ham, and one that relieves some of the pressure on manager Slaven Bilic. On the balance of play and chances created they probably deserved it too.
For Huddersfield, their first goals conceded as a Premier League team and their first defeat.
Stay tuned for highlights and reaction.

90+3: Change for West Ham as Obiang is replaced by Rice.

90+2: Huddersfield are enjoying more of the possession but there's no real cutting edge. Smith then slices an attempted first-time cross straight behind for a goal-kick.

90: Looking quite comfortable for West Ham. They are closing on a much-needed win.
Four minutes to be added on.

87: West Ham are now sitting deep with almost everyone behind the ball. They get stretched a bit as Mounie slips it into the box for Ince, but his shot is well blocked.

85: Do Huddersfield have a late flourish in them? They have responded well in the last five minutes or so.

83: Another switch for Huddersfield as summer signing Depoitre comes on for Billing.

82: A warm round of applause for Carroll as he is replaced by Sakho. Good performance from Carroll in the first half before he faded somewhat after half-time.

81: OFF THE BAR! Huddersfield go close again as the ball falls for Ince in the box and he smacks a shot against the top of the bar. It took a slight deflection on its way.

80: SAVE! Decent effort from Mounie as he gets off a quick shot from 20 yards and Hart has to be alert to turn it behind.

Ayew's introduction for Hernandez wasn't well received by some fans, but Slaven Bilic's move pays off. A corner is flicked on by Fonte at the near post, hits a defender on the line and Ayew slides in to finish from close range.

77: What a performance this has been from Antonio. He has caused Huddersfield so many problems with his pace and direct running.
He gets around the outside of his marker and puts in a dangerous cross which is well headed behind.

75: Huddersfield respond with a change as Sabiri comes on for Kachunga.

How's your luck? This is certainly one of the more fortuitous goals you will see. Obiang's shot from around 25 yards takes a big deflection, which completely wrong-foots Lossl, and he can only watch as it sails past him and goes in off the post.
A huge goal for West Ham and Slaven Bilic does not look like he cares one jot about how fortunate it was.

71: CHANCE! Inches away for West Ham. Inches.
Cresswell swings in a free-kick from the left and, with Huddersfield playing a very high line, there are three West Ham players unmarked in the middle. But it's just a bit ahead of them all and Collins can only poke through to Lossl.

69: SHOT! Malone does well to break down the left and then play it inside for Mooy, who lines up a shot from 25 yards and drives it over the bar.

67: The game is becoming a bit more open. West Ham are not as dominant as they were in the first half and Huddersfield are starting to create a bit more. 
Still not many clear chances for either side mind.

Live West Ham v Huddersfield markets right here.

65: And now West Ham make their first switch. It's not too well received either, with a few boos as Hernandez is replaced by Ayew.

64: Change for Huddersfield as Lowe is replaced by Malone.

63: A look of frustration on the face of Carroll as a cross from Zabaleta sails straight behind for a goal-kick. The striker hasn't had much service this half.

61: A roar of applause from the away end as Huddersfield win their first corner of the match. It comes to nothing though.

59: A little lucky for Zanka as he is running backwards and slices a volley just wide of his own goal. The original ball was aimed towards Carroll, who hasn't been involved as much in the second half.

56: CLOSE! Nice first-time flick through from Hernandez for Kouyate, who turns in the box but can't get away from Schindler and shoots a few yards wide of goal.

54: SHOT! Hart called into action for the first time this evening to get down and save a long-range shot from Billing. Not too difficult a save but he did well to hold on to the ball.

53: Marko Arnautovic is watching on from the stands. He's serving the final match of a three-game ban. Will be interesting to see where he fits into this side on his return.

51: Good patient build-up play with Huddersfield as they keep possession well under pressure. Ultimately it comes to nothing, though, as Lowe's first-time cross is hit straight behind.

49: Not a good challenge from Zabaleta as he goes sliding in on Van La Parra and makes no contact with the ball. Clear yellow card.

48: Poor free-kick from Hernandez, scooped high over the bar.
For all West Ham's threat, Lossl hasn't really had many saves to make. Just one shot on target so far from the hosts.

47: Antonio with a good recovery tackle to dispossess Mooy and he's then fouled as he gets the ball and drives forward. Free-kick to West Ham around 25 yards, centre of goal.

No changes at the break and it's West Ham who get the game restarted.

The numbers pretty much tell the story of the opening 45 minutes.

Sam Allardyce: "West Ham just haven’t found the final clear-cut chance, except for
that Hernandez chance, which you would have expected him to put in the back of
the net. The front three has been causing havoc for the Huddersfield defence.
"Antonio is a terrific player and is causing a lot of problems down either side for Huddersfield. Carroll has also been a big threat."



It's finished goalless at Turf Moor with defences on top.

90: We're into three minutes of added time. Mooy's free-kick is into the wall.

90: Defour is robbed by Van La Parra and he runs forward before being taken out by Tarkowski. Definite yellow card. 

89: SUB! Kachunga claps the away fans as he is replaced by the youngster Florent Hadergjonaj.

88: Brady tries to find Wood through the middle with a telling pass but Schindler is across once more to clear the danger.
Van La Parra runs at Lowton, but there's no quality in his delivery. Neither side deserve to win this one.

86: There's a wrestling match going on between Tarkowski and Jorgensen as Brady hangs over a free-kick, and Kavanagh has a word with both players. Not a lot in that, but the set piece eventually comes to nothing.

84: SHOT! Wood has been quiet today since that early chance in the first half, but he tries his luck from outside the box this time as he turns Schindler and fires low into the body of Lossl.

82: BLOCK! Clever ball from Lowton into the feet of Barnes but Mooy is there to intercept.

80: SUB! Huddersfield introduce Philip Billing for Jonathan Hogg for the final 10 minutes.

78: SUB! Second change for Burnley as Gudmundsson comes on for Scott Arfield.

76: SAVE! Van La Parra, relishing his special treatment, gets on the ball again and now goes for goal himself, but Pope gets down smartly to tip the shot around the post. Mooy's delivery comes to nothing.

75: FOUL! Van La Parra is booed as he runs with the ball down the left, and his far-post cross is met by Kachunga, but he is penalised for a foul on Mee.

75: SUB! Hendrick makes way for Ashley Barnes.

74: Defour is having a good game for Burnley as he gets across the pitch to intercept Lossl's ball out to Ince. We've got a little over 15 minutes to find a winner at Turf Moor.

72: DIVE! Van La Parra is getting booked by Kavanagh for going down far too easily with Lowton for company. It spoiled a good situation for Huddersfield and the substitute is deservedly booked for simulation.

70: OFFSIDE! Brady's delivery is excellent, but Tarkowski heads towards goal in an offside position.


68: There's an expectation in the Burnley fans to win today, but their side haven't done enough to be ahead with Huddersfield having the better chances of this second half. Hendrick wins a free-kick off Zanka, so here's a good situation for them on the left.

66: CLOSE! That's inches wide from Ince! Mooy cuts inside from the left and finds the former Derby winger in position and this time he goes for goal, firing low with his left foot, but the ball zips just wide of Pope's left post!

63: SUB! Substitution for Huddersfield as Sabiri is replaced by Rajiv van La Parra.


62: SHOT! Burnley look to break as Brady cuts inside from the right and fires low, but Lossl gathers comfortably.

59: Arfield has seen a lot of the ball but he, like Brady, hasn't done enough with it in threatening areas. Schindler clears the danger once more when Hendrick was gearing up for a shot.

57: CHANCE! Ward does really well to get his cross in from the left, and Wood gets across Schindler to direct his shot towards goal, but there's no pace on the effort and it's easily gathered by Lossl. 
Huddersfield fans are singing, 'Is this a library?' It's quiet.

55: Mee escapes a card following a foul on Sabiri, and Mooy will now deliver the free-kick from the right. It's too close to Pope, who opts to punch clear. 

53: SHOT! It's far more open now as Schindler tackles Arfield and the ball is quickly moved up the other end, resulting in Sabiri trying his luck, but his shot is wild and over the bar.

52: Burnley are yet to get going in this second half as Mee looks for the isolated Wood once more. But there's no-one around him to feed off the knock-down.

49: CHANCE! Tom Ince does really well to run through the middle and release Depoitre, but the striker telegraphs his shot and Pope gets down to save. It never looked convincing and Ben Mee scrambles the ball clear.

47: SHOT! Kachunga wins a corner off Ward from the off, with Mooy coming over to take the set piece. The Australian picks out Smith on the edge of the box, but he opts to take a touch first before blazing his shot over. It was always rising.

46: Burnley get us back under way here.


45+1: Scott Arfield has just produced a candidate for the worst foul throws of the season. He was in two minds and the ball drifted out of his hands. There goes the half-time whistle.

45: Burnley look to end the half on a high but Stephen Ward's delivery is cleared by the resolute Huddersfield defence. There will be two minutes of additional time at the end of this first period.

43: SHOT! Mooy feeds the ball to Kachunga from about 30 yards out, and the forward tries his luck, but the effort sails harmlessly over Pope's crossbar. Plenty of commitment but no end product has been the story of the half.

42: The final ball just hasn't been there for Burnley as Cork looks to lift the ball through to Arfield but he's never getting on the end of that.

40: Five minutes to go plus any stoppage time in this first half.

35: The Huddersfield fans are in full voice behind the goal to the right as their side enjoy a period of possession. Smith then very nearly gets robbed by a lively Brady but the defender manages to clear just in time. 
More long balls and crunching tackles but very little quality in the final third.
Schindler gets himself in the way of Ward's ball towards Wood in the six-yard box after excellent work from Defour and Brady. That's better from Burnley.

30: OFFSIDE! Sabiri runs with the ball through the middle of the pitch unchallenged but he decides to thread a ball into the path of Depoitre when the striker has drifted two yards offside. 

29: Huddersfield are pressing from the front to force errors out of a Burnley side who aren't used to having too much possession. David Wagner will be pleased with how things have gone so far. 
Lowe goes in late on Brady, and after that flurry of cards earlier on, the Huddersfield defender is lucky not to go into the book.


25: YELLOW! Arfield receives a yellow card for a late challenge on Smith. Tom Ince has the chance to whip the ball in from a dangerous position on the right, but he over-hits his delivery out for a goal-kick.

24: CHANCE! Lovely exchange between Arfield and Stephen Ward down the left, and the full-backs delivery is right onto the head of Wood, but the striker glances his effort a yard wide of the post! Best chance of the match so far. The cross deserved so much better.

20: Mooy has been becoming increasingly influential and Huddersfield have earned another corner. It's a crowded penalty box but Huddersfield bizarrely try the short corner and the danger is cleared.

18: That looked like a back-pass from Tarkowski to keeper Pope, but the referee doesn't see it that way, and Burnley escape what would've been a dangerous situation.

17: It's now Huddersfield's turn to attack as Lowe wins a corner off Brady. Mooy comes over to take the set piece, but his cross is claimed by Nick Pope.

16: Zanka concedes a corner off Chris Wood, who is getting some stick from behind the goal from Huddersfield fans for his Leeds past. Brady's delivery is picked up from Scott Arfield, and Ince concedes another corner.
Brady's left-footed inswinger is then cleared at the near post by Depoitre.

14: Steven Defour tries to bring some urgency to this slow start but Schindler is there to make a second interception in quick succession. Huddersfield are defending doggedly so far, but they need to get more support to Depoitre.

9: OFFSIDE! Burnley have made an aggressive start with Chris Wood rising to head a yard wide from Robbie Brady's delivery, but the former Leeds forward had drifted into an offside position.

7: BOOKING! Jack Cork is next to go into Kavanagh's book immediately from the free-kick as he goes in strong on Sabiri. He might have got the ball but he certainly caught the player. Fierce challenges have come to the fore early on at Turf Moor.


Slaven Bilic has been and gone in the West Ham media centre. He was in sombre mood and let out a big sigh as he left the room.
Here's the best lines..
“We felt this was going to be the game to bring back the
confidence – we looked good in the week in preparation.”
“We were too ordinary in front of the box – nothing special.
We was waiting for the ball to drop to us.”
“I’m not going to pinpoint players in the media. I take full
responsibility. I’m not happy with the performance.”


"The board will do what they are going to do. It is their
decision. We have been in this situation before and we got out. As a manager
you take the credit and as a manager you take the full responsibility. I don’t want to hide.
"I’m not worried [about the sack]. I’m doing my best."

The West Ham manager has been speaking to Sky Sports.
"It was a bad performance. The goals killed us, the first one
very quick. Between the first and second goal we were dominating the game. 
"They
defended the box really good and at the end of the first half we conceded from
a bit of skill from their player. It is very hard for me to say anything clever
in this moment apart from it’s very disappointing.
"As manager I take full responsibility."

Gary Neville was scathing on Marko Arnautovic.
"I have only ever played with one player that had an excuse
not to track back and that was Cristiano Ronaldo. He scored 40 goals in a
season. 
"That guy [Arnautovic] is Ronaldo in his own mind. That’s the problem,
he thinks he is better than he is."

Here's West Ham defender Jose Fonte.
"Obviously very disappointing. Not the performance we wanted
to produce, not the performance the fans deserve. We need to look ourselves in
the mirror. 
"It happened a few times last season and we have to put this right.
This is West Ham."

Video reaction on its way but here's a taste of Chris Hughton's delight - at a clean sheet as well as victory.
"I thought it was outstanding. A huge part of the game is how you defend. You can't stop all the crosses going in - they have really good quality - but you have to defend well. It gives you the platform to have chances yourself and we did that. 
"I'm as pleased with the clean sheet as I am with the goals. We used the ball well, nullified the qualities they have and scored good goals ourselves. To come away with a clean sheet in this type of environment shows real quality, real discipline."


"It’s huge for Brighton. A lot of those Brighton players
haven’t been in the Premier League before so Chris Hughton will know how important psychologically
it is to pick up points on the road. 
"You need that belief away from home. There
won’t be many easier three points than tonight."

The Brighton striker struck twice tonight and the man of the match has been speaking to Sky Sports.
"I'm delighted to get my chance and I think I have taken it. We have a great defensive unit, we spring to the wings well, and we have great wingers to supply me."

All over at the London Stadium, where West Ham have been comprehensively beaten by an impressive Brighton.
Glenn Murray scored twice - one a header and another a penalty - while Jose Izquierdo opened his Premier League account with a stunner.
A superb night for the visitors, but a miserable evening for Slaven Bilic and his team. This was an awful performance.
The stadium was almost empty at the final whistle - apart from the away supporters - but the boos for the hosts were still audible.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

89: It's been a magnificent Brighton performance, led by a superb partnership between Dunk and Duffy at the heart of their defence.
Hernandez has not had a sniff for West Ham.

86: We are playing out these final minutes in front of a deserted London Stadium. Well, apart from a vocal Brighton contingent, bouncing up and down in the away end. What a trip this has been for them.
A first away victory in the Premier League and their first away top-flight league win since 1983.

84: SUB! Brighton make their final change as Knockaert is replaced by Schelotto.

81: That sums it up for West Ham. Hart tries to take a goal kick short and his defenders are asleep. It rolls out for a throw-in. Bilic stands arms crossed on the touchline. This is ugly.

77: SUB! Izzy Brown replaces Pascal Gross for Brighton.

Cool as you like from Murray as Hart dives full length to his right and the Brighton striker sticks it down the middle.
The West Ham fans have seen enough.

75: PENALTY TO BRIGHTON! It might be three now! Bruno digs out a cross and Zabaleta gets caught underneath it. He can't recover quickly enough and his rash challenge brings down Murrray.

74: CHANCE! It should be three! Brilliant work by Knockaert as he leaves Lanzini and Reid for dead and picks the perfect pass for Murray. Hart makes himself big and smothers the shot. A good save.
SUB! Fernandes replaces Arnautovic for West Ham. The former Stoke man does not get a good reception from the home crowd, it's been a poor night.

73: West Ham are trying to pressure Brighton but the visitors are picking their passes well and playing it around their opponents. The Hammers look like they are tiring, it's been a dispiriting evening so far.

69: SUB! He scored Brighton's brilliant second but Izquierdo is now withdrawn, replaced by Solly March. 

68: Bong times his challenge on Antonio perfectly and the two players start jawing before the resulting set-piece. If the Brighton man was a fraction late, that was a penalty.
Lanzini takes the corner and Dunk rises to clear again. 


65: CLOSE! Better from Lanzini this time as his effort takes a slight deflection off the top of the wall and out for a corner. Ryan was scrambling.
The resulting corner is cleared by the visitors.

64: West Ham win another free-kick in a similar position as Knockaert fouls Ayew, who showed quick feet. Will it be Lanzini again? Arnautovic is lurking.

63: Dreadful. Lanzini takes it on from fully 34/35 yards and the playmaker blasts the ball well over the bar. More whistles from the crowd.

62: Reid takes matters into his own hands, charging forward and feeding Hernandez - something his midfielders have not done all game. The forward turns and is upended by Gross. West Ham free-kick in a good position.

60: The home crowd are not happy. There's whistles audible as Antonio takes a couple of poor touches and Hernandez can't chase it down.

58: There's Oles from the Brighton fans as their team keeps possession for a couple of minutes. Quite early for that.

56: OFFSIDE! It's another great delivery from Gross and Duffy rattles the post with a header. The assistant's flag is up though - correctly - because Duffy was a yard offside.

55: Arnautovic is having a nightmare. He gives the ball away cheaply on the right and then gives away a silly free-kick to compound the mistake. His frustration is really showing.

53: Better from Ayew and Lanzini as they work the ball to Masuaku, who wins a corner. He really should have beaten the first man, though.
Lanzini swings in the corner - Ryan flaps and is nowhere near it - but Obiang can't make contact at the back post. Bilic grits his teeth on the touchline.

51: Arnautovic has not actually endeared himself to West Ham fans since his move from Stoke - and his cross just then at the near post was awful. Straight at Ryan, who easily collected.
In the words of Jamie Carragher, he's been "really poor tonight".

49: Brighton's last away top-flight victory? March 1983 at The Vetch against Swansea. They are less than 45 minutes away from ending that run.

46: SUB! Bilic is making a change - Andre Ayew replaces Kouyate.
We are back under way for the second half.

Gary Neville's been dissecting that half - and it's a scathing assessment of West Ham's display.
"The mentality in that first 20 minutes is shocking - you'll get your manager done. 
"Concentration, urgency.  nothing. Well done to Brighton but that's such a poor half from West Ham. It's woeful - the fans don't deserve what they saw in that first 20 minutes in particular."




Brighton lead at the break thanks to goals by Murray and Izquierdo - a super away performance so far. West Ham go off to boos from the home crowd.
They need a big second half.

What a goal! Brighton have their second and it's a stunner by Izquierdo.
The winger cuts inside from the left and curls a beauty past Hart - the Hammers 'keeper got a hand to it but couldn't keep it out.
A massive goal for Brighton - perfectly timed just before the break.

45+2: SAVE! A massive stop by Hart! West Ham are carved open and Murray is through on goal but Hart beats it away. He should score.

45: CLOSE! Hernandez whistles a shot just wide from 22 yards. Ryan was scrambling in the Brighton goal but he probably had it covered.
TWO minutes of added time.

44: Bruno gives the ball away and Arnautovic drives forward but his low cross evades Antonio.
Brighton are on the ropes a little bit as we approach half-time.

42: OFFSIDE! A great pass by Obiang unlocks the Brighton defence - but Duffy and Dunk had their line right. Hernandez is just ahead of the play. Ryan smothered his effort anyway.

39: BLOCK! Brilliant by Duffy! The cross by Zabaleta comes in from the right and Hernandez looks free. He spins and fires a low shot on goal but Duffy is there to block for the visitors.

38: CHANCE! Gross picks out Knockaert with a fantastic low cross and Obiang almost brings the Brighton forward down in the box. But Knockaert stays on his feet - Obiang doesn't make contact - and Masuaku cleans up for West Ham.

31: It's all West Ham now and Chris Hughton looks a little anxious on the touchline. His team are doing well to close up the central avenues but Antonio is starting to get joy down the right.


26: The London Stadium comes to life as West Ham up the tempo, delivering a series of dangerous crosses into the Brighton box. The visitors stand firm and Propper eventually scrambles away for a corner.
Zabaleta's cross drops to Lanzini but Bong covers well for Brighton, conceding a corner. More desperate defending by Hughton's side keeps the score level. It took a while, but West Ham are well and truly in this game now.


ALL OVER!  A first win for Swansea, but it is three defeats in a row for Palace. Very poor once more from the home side as they search for a first goal of the season. Goals either side of half time saw the Swans home.

90+2: Palace seem to have given up the ghost here. Swansea taking every opportunity to run the clock down. 

90: Three minutes of added time here.

88: CHANCE! Long ball over the top looks to be right on the head of Benteke, but the former Liverpool hitman misses the ball altogether. Sums up Palace's afternoon.

87: Final change for Swansea, with Angel Rangel replacing Naughton. 

85: CHANCE! As good a chance as Palace have had. The ball falls to Townsend on the edge of the box, he elects to try slot it into the bottom corner, but it rolls agonisingly wide

83: Cabaye lines up a free-kick, but gets underneath it and the ball curls over the top of Fabianski's crossbar. 


82: Two bookings in quick succession as Fer and Cabaye are cautioned for deliberate fouls.

80: Another change for Swansea as young Oliver McBurnie replaces the excellent Abraham.

78: Wonderful footwork from Abraham as he controls the ball, nicks it away from Ward before being fouled. Yellow card. 

76: Townsend again tries his luck, but the same result, as the ball rolls harmlessly wide. 

74: Half chance for McArthur as he prods the ball towards goal, but straight at Fabianski. 

72: Change for Swansea as Wayne Routledge comes on for Van der Hoorn. 

70: Another long ball into the box is plucked out of the air by Fabianski. This man's goal still gives Palace breathing space. 

68: TACKLE! Superbly-timed tackle from Van der Hoorn thwarts Cabaye as he was about to pull the trigger. Excellent defending from the visitors once more. 

66: NO PENALTY! Lee is down in the box, but cries from the stands fall on deaf ears as referee Marriner waves away penalty claims. 


64: Townsend again works space for the shot well, but that is an easy save for Fabianski. Much better from the home side in the last ten minutes.

62: McArthur gets up to meet a high cross, but he cannot guide the ball on target. 

60: Better from Townsend, as he drives inside before curling an effort at goal, but that is never troubling Fabianski as it flies wide.

58: Here is that change. Yohan Cabaye makes his way into the pitch, with Luka Milivojevic the man to come off. More creativity is needed. 

56: Fabianski climbs to collect the ball, and plucks it out of the sky. Fine goalkeeping. Benteke was lurking with intent. 

54: Ward whips a cross into the middle, but that is meat and drink for Mawson. Palace have to be more creative.

52: De Boer has to use his final roll of the dice. Benteke is getting absolutely no service or support up front. 

50: Very odd feeling around the ground. It is almost as if fans are resigned to their fate. No endeavour and no conviction from the home side.

Dreadful from Palace, but ruthless from the visitors. Kelly is caught in possession, Naughton nips in, feeds the ball through for Ayew, Hennessey comes out, elects to go with his feet, Ayew wins the 50:50, and walks the ball home. Boos ring down from the terraces.

47: SAVE! Almost an immediate riposte from Palace, but Kelly's header from a corner is well saved by Fabianski, who hangs on to the ball.

KICK OFF! We are back under way here. One change for Palace, with Chung-Yong Lee replacing Van Aaonholt.



45+2: That's your lot for the first half. Very, very poor from the home side once more. Swansea haven't exactly had to work too hard for their lead. 19-year-old Abraham is up and running. Superb finish. Boos all round as we go into the break. 

45: Two minutes of added time at the end of the half. 

A first Premier League goal for Abraham gives the visitors the lead with their first shot on target this season! Great ball in from Fer, but Abraham does superbly as he stumbles, adjusting quickly to guide the ball past Hennessey on the volley. You get the feeling there's more to come from this boy.

42: Tomkins has a few minutes he'd rather forget, First, he loops an effort well over the top, and then injures himself as he runs back! Martin Kelly comes on to take his place.

40: MISS! It is all happening here! From the resulting corner, Mawson climbs highest, unmarked, six yards out, but heads wide, with Hennessey beaten. 

38: SAVE! That's more like it! Great tenacity from Abraham, who refuses to give up on a lost cause, forces Fosu-Mensah into a mistake, prods for goal, but Hennessey sticks out a foot to block. 

36: This is very, very tepid. Both sides are being so negative. Confidence is very low, but at least try to create something, lads!

34: Not known for his goalscoring prowess, Jason Puncheon has a go from distance on the volley. Well wide. 

32: This isn't going to be the usual goalfest between these two, that is for sure. Defences well and truly on top.


30: CLOSE! As good as we have seen from Palace this afternoon. Townsend spreads the ball across to McArthur, who takes a touch, before rifling an effort just past the post from the edge of the box.

28: Better ball retention from Palace, but every time they work space to create an opening, they go long to Benteke, who is immediately pounced upon. 

26: Still very cagey here. Neither side are showing enough endeavour to work an opening. Palace fans growing more and more frustrated. 

24: Finally a shot from Palace, but it wasn't worth the wait as Townsend drags an effort well wide.

22: Still all the possession with the visitors, mostly in their own half. Palace are trying to break, but they are far too sloppy. 

20: Better possession for Swansea. They are keeping the ball really well, looking for openings. Palace very rigid. 

18: McArthur gets up highest to meet a cross from Townsend, but heads wide. Benteke is furious as he felt he was better placed behind McArthur.

16: Andros Townsend whips a cross into the middle, Benteke heads it up in the air, Kyle Naughton gets his clearance all wrong, sending the ball back towards his own goal, but a combination of Lukasz Fabianski and Alfie Mawson clear the danger.

That's all from us - stay tuned to skysports com and the app, as well as Sky Sports News, for more fallout.
In the meantime, head over to Sky Sports Premier league for another tasty Super Sunday clash between Tottenham and Liverpool.


Arsene Wenger has talked up the "full power" of his Arsenal side.

Here's your chance to hear from the Everton manager himself.

Beleaguered Ronald Koeman has told Sky Sports it's too too late to oversee a change in fortune but what do the pundits make of the Everton boss's position following another defeat?
Henry: "The board has to decide. I hope he can stay but it looks like it will be very difficult."
Souness: "His problem is he spent a lot of money in the summer, expectation level went through the roof. They're passionate supporters, the Evertonians. They won't like it it and won't accept it for very long."



"It was a very good (response). They conceded a goal early but right from the start you could see they were going to mean business today. From Everton's point of view, that's exactly how you don't play against Arsenal - you give them time to play and you're in trouble. They could have scored five in each half, in fairness."


Let's hear from man of the match Mesut Ozil and team-mate Per Mertesacker:
Mertesacker: "We started really well only to find ourselves 1-0 behind but we stuck to the gameplan. Mesut was crucial today, the way he created chances. We don't need other people to judge what we do; we analyse it ourselves on the training ground and the only way to answer is on the pitch."
Ozil: "We are so happy to win the game. We showed character. We believe in ourselves. We showed our quality from the start to the end."

Here's confirmation of the Premier League table, ahead of the second part of Super Sunday - Tottenham v Liverpool.


Everton chairman Bill Kenwright is head-in-hands as Sanchez makes it five - and there's the whistle.
Arsenal up to sixth but Everton - despite that big summer spending spree under Ronald Koeman - slip into the bottom three for the first time this season.

Goals, goals, goals! Alexis Sanchez strolls across the face of the box, finds a yard on the right, and somehow finds the bottom left corner from what seemed an impossible angle.
Boos ring around Goodison Park, and that should be that in terms of scoring! There's smoke coming off my keyboard.

It won't impact the scoreline, but that's awful from Arsenal.
Monreal plays a very, very weak backpass to Cech, he looks to take on Niasse but is wrestled off the ball, and the Everton striker sticks it into the empty net.
Bizarre, bizarre goal.

90+2: Five minutes added. Everton want this over sharpish.
Half of Goodison has left as Sigurdsson hits a free-kick well over the bar. 

"Everton are sliced open so simply. Wilshere sees the run and the first touch from Ramsey is brilliant." 
That Arsenal fourth coming up shortly if you're with us on mobile.

Icing on the cake and the cherry on top. Wilshere peels off Davies, finds Ramsey free in space just outside the box, and feeds a lovely through ball to him.
Great first touch by the Welshman, and he sits Pickford down with a nice finish to the goalkeeper's right as he dives left. 

90: Sanchez with a looping cross towards Kolasinac inside the box, but his header is off target. Arsenal very comfortable here.

88: Ironic cheers around Goodison as Koscielny goes in late on Niasse and gets a yellow from Craig Pawson. 

86: OFF THE BAR! What a hit from Xhaka. He drives forward, the options close down so he sticks his laces through it. 
He cannons off the bar and clear, before Pickford just about collects the rebound under pressure from Ramsey.

84: Ozil comes off after a good afternoon's work, replaced by Coquelin for the final few minutes. 

82: Wilshere finds Sanchez open on the last defender, but he gives him too much to do, and it runs through to Pickford to collect. 

80: Everton's first shot on target since the goal.  and it's straight into the hands of Cech from Davies' long-range effort. 

78: That's Lacazette's afternoon over. Wilshere is on for the final 12 minutes, cue huge cheers from the Arsenal fans.

76: Huge groan from the Everton fans as Calvert-Lewin is replaced by Lookman. The youngster has been one of Everton's best players. 

That should be that.
Perfect sweeping counter by Arsenal after Vlasic gave the ball away cheaply in midfield. Bellerin feeds Ramsey on the right, with four Arsenal shirts supporting him in the box. 
He squares for Lacazette, who makes no mistake first time from 10 yards. Pickford, no chance.

73: They're trying, however. Baines sticks in a good ball, but the area is packed full of Arsenal players, and Mertesacker clears. He's done superbly today, the big German. 

71: Weird atmosphere at Goodison Park. They're only a goal behind, but there's almost a resignation among Everton fans that they won't get back into this game.

68: RED CARD FOR IDRISSA GUEYE!
Deserved second yellow for Idrissa Gueye, and a massive uphill task now for Everton.
He catches Xhaka late in midfield, and Pawson sends him off. Silly foul, he needs to be more disciplined there. 

66: Vlasic turns well on the right and fizzes in a cross, but it's across the face of goal, with no blue shirt in sight. 

64: The game has finally calmed down a tad.  it only took around an hour! Everton look slightly more solid at the back now, but Arsenal have the lead going into the final 25 minutes.

62: Arsenal corner. Ozil takes, Mertesacker gets up ahead of Pickford but can't get enough on it, then Sanchez's effort is blocked by Vlasic. 


59: Calvert-Lewin has received an accidental boot to the face from Monreal. Ouch.
Blood is streaming from his nose, and this could be a lengthy stoppage.

56: CHANCE! Nearly a third for Arsenal. Koscielny somehow gets past Sigurdsson on the right, pulls it back to the penalty spot for Ramsey, but he chooses to take it first time in space!
He could have taken a touch, and he blazes it over the crossbar!

"It's a brilliant Arsenal goal - Ozil makes a great run and does just the right thing - doesn't head it too strongly, just helps it on. "

Sanchez with the cross, Ozil with the finish. Arsenal may not have assurances that they'll be with them for the long-term, but they've combined brilliantly here. 
Lacazette knocks it on for Sanchez on the left, and the Chilean spots the run of Ozil inside the box. Sanchez dinks in a beautiful, teasing ball, plum on the head of the German to head past Pickford. Fine goal!

53: Vlasic gets in-behind Arsenal on the right. He gets into the area, turns and shoots, but it's blocked by Koscielny. 

53: Calvert-Lewin's lovely touch down the right puts him through to the byline, but his cross is cleared well by Koscielny. The youngster has had a good game, so far.

51: More Arsenal pressure.  Bellerin has seen a lot of the ball on the right, but nothing quite falling for the visitors inside the box. 

49: Free-kick to Arsenal now. It's about 35 yards out, and instead of crossing Sanchez goes for goal, taking into account the wind here. It slams against the ribs of Vlasic, however.

47: Free-kick to Everton on the right. Sigurdsson is over it, Keane heads towards goal, but it's over the bar under pressure from Xhaka. 

46: Back underway in the second half, and a change by Koeman. Tom Davies comes on, Ashley Williams makes way.
A change in system for the hosts, going to a back four with Jagielka and Keane in the middle. 


HT: That's the half. Plenty of goalmouth action, mainly around Everton's posts, but it's level at the break.
Rooney opened the scoring against the run of play, but Monreal levelled later in the half. Arsenal have had chance after chance, and though Pickford could be blamed for the equaliser, his saves have kept Everton in this at 1-1. 

45+2: Sigurdsson with a deep free-kick, Koscielny heads it over the crossbar, but Pawson gives a goal kick! Everton fuming.

45+1: Two minutes added time at Goodison. What a half this has been!

45: CHANCE! Kolasinac feeds Ozil, who has Sanchez running off him inside the area on the left.  he finds him, he takes a touch and looks to lift it over Pickford from six yards, at a bit of an angle, but Pickford blocks superbly!
Arsenal have had 15 attempts on goal already in this first half, and many of them very good chances!

44: Monreal is fuming here. The ball is running out of play near the touchline, and Calvert-Lewin gives him a shove in the back. He goes toppling over the advertising boards, and runs back towards the Everton man ranting and raving.
Rightly so, that could have been dangerous, but Pawson leaves his cards in his pocket. 

42: CHANCE! Nearly another for Arsenal! The Gunners break forward and find Bellerin on the right of the box.  he's at an angle, and cuts it wide of Pickford's goal. 

That's all we have from Stamford Bridge today, many thanks for joining us. 
Head over to our Man Utd v Everton blog where Antonio Valencia has scored a superb goal to put the hosts ahead inside five minutes. 


You can also watch the match highlights from Chelsea v Arsenal by hitting play on the video below. Enjoy!

Hear from Antonio Conte following this afternoon's match.

Hear from Arsene Wenger following today's draw.

Thierry Henry was on hand to give his take of Arsenal's draw with Chelsea in the Sky Sports studio, and says the performance was certainly better than their last away game - a 5-0 defeat to Liverpool.
"It wasn’t difficult for Arsenal to be better than they
were against Liverpool. It was standard, for me, for what you need to do away
from home. Whether you are playing the champions or not you need to be careful
of what’s going to happen. 
"Yes, it was way better, they got a point and Aaron Ramsey
was way better but the team defended better. The wingers were tucking in and
helping and recovering. The three at the back were better also because the job
was done in front of them. Everything was better today."


Aaron Ramsey has been speaking to Sky Sports after the game, and said Arsenal have shown an improvement today.
"We needed that against a top team. We’ve come here in recent
years and struggled but we showed today that we can compete against the best."


There's the whistle and it's all over at Stamford Bridge.
Overall, an entertaining game that ended with ten men as David Luiz was shown a straight red card late on after a crunching tackle on Sead Kolasinac. 
It's the third fixture in a row that the Blues have had a man sent off against Arsenal in all competitions, and the Gunners will ultimately be pleased with a point from their trip across London. 
Stay tuned for match highlights in 15 minutes! 

90+3: Bellerin in the book now for another gritty foul as Arsenal look to see out this game with a point from Stamford Bridge.

90+2: Chelsea are arguing that Kolasinac should be sent off as he commits another foul in the space of a few minutes, but Michael Oliver doesn't agree as the hosts win the free kick. 
Fabregas delivers but Cech makes an easy collection. 

90: Four minutes added on as Kolasinac is booked for a foul on Hazard. 

89: Free kick to Arsenal now as Hazard is penalised for a foul on Koscielny. It's about 40 yards out and Xhaka is over it.  
It's not his best though and Chelsea clear well. 
Meanwhile, Chelsea make their final change as Christensen replaces Morata. 

87: RED CARD LUIZ! David Luiz is sent off for a second yellow after an absolutely crunching tackle on Kolasinac. 
It's reckless from Luiz and he knows he's off, as soon as it happens as he slides in on the Arsenal midfielder with his studs up. He was booked earlier but it's a straight red for the Chelsea defender for that one.

86: A good low cross from Fabregas there as Chelsea have a period of pressure around the Arsenal box, but no one can connect but an Arsenal foot as the hosts win a corner. 
Fabregas delivers and the initial clearance falls to Moses but his shot is well blocked by a sea of red shirts. 

84: Free kick to Chelsea as Elneny clatters into a tackle on Hazard. He sees a yellow card for his troubles.

83: An inviting ball into the box from Sanchez has Giroud leaping to meet it, but he is well marked by Cahill and cannot connect as the looping cross goes out of play. 

81: Here comes the Elneny change with Iwobi making way. 

80: SAVE! A great save from Cech there as Hazard dances towards the top of the box in true Hazard style, leaving Xhaka on the floor but his eventual shot is well saved by Cech, who stretches up high to collect.

79: Mohamed Elneny is being readied for Arsenal as we head towards the final ten minutes. 

76: OFFSIDE!!!!! Oh dear Mustafi.  Arsenal should be ahead! 
Xhaka delivers the free kick and it's a lovely back post header from the German - but he is way, way offside and the linesman's flag is raised as he wheels away to celebrate. 
He has a look of shock when he realises as the Chelsea fans jeer his early celebrations. 

75: Arsenal again have a free kick but in a better spot this time, just on the right as Bakayoko fouls Ramsey.

74: A free kick to Arsenal as Sanchez tries to trick his way out of trouble, but a foul from Luiz sees the Gunners win a deep set piece. 

73: Welbeck won't see out the game as Olivier Giroud comes on for the injured striker.


72: Another man down, this time it's Welbeck after a clash with Luiz. He appears to be holding his groin as the medical stafff come on.


69: And here's the switch, as Willian makes way for Hazard.

68: Anything Arsenal can do.  Eden Hazard is stripped and ready to come on for Chelsea on the sidelines. 

66: SUB! Here comes the cavalry as Lacazette makes way for Alexis Sanchez. 

65: Morata goes into the book now after a foul on Mustafi. He's not pleased about it though and you can see why - he's been fouled numerous times this game and no one has really been penalised.  


63: Another decent move from Arsenal as Welbeck goes up against Kante and comes off the better, sliding the ball into a pocket of space on the left of the box that is latched on to by Kolasinac. 
But Moses is tracking the midfielder and does his job well with the eventual shot from the Arsenal man pushed behind by a sliding Azpilicueta. 

61: Another Chelsea free kick on the left as Morata is once again fouled, this time Mustafi. Fabregas takes it short to Willian down the channel with the Brazilian cutting into space at the top corner before shooting - but it goes high over the bar. 
Moses is screaming for the ball at the top of the box with his arms outstretched, but his calls go unanswered. 

58: A decent passage of play from Arsenal there as Ramsey powers forward through midfield before laying the ball off to Welbeck on his right. 
The Arsenal forward then attempts to slide the Welshman in down the left of the box as he tries to find the space, but Courtois reads the situation well and is out to collect. 

56: Not a bad ball from Ramsey there as he picks out the run of Lacazette in the box, and slides the ball diagonally as he searches for the striker. 
The Frenchman almost gets there too but some good defending from Azpilicueta sees Lacazette muscled off the ball before it is put behind.

54: Koscielny is back on his feet and looks OK to continue. Chelsea come on the break after the restart as Bakayoko powers forward, laying the ball off to Alonso who shoots - but it clatters off a red body and goes wide.

52: Free kick to Chelsea just to the right of centre as Monreal clatters into the back of Morata as the striker attempts to stride forward.
As Fabregas delivers, there's a melee in the middle and Koscielny is down after taking a boot to the face from Luiz, who had tried an overhead kick. 
The Chelsea defender is booked after checking on the Frenchman in the immediate aftermath. 

49: Snapshot efforts from both sides as Morata shoots but has his effort blocked by a leaping Arsenal body before Welbeck breaks at the other end, but is caught in possession by Luiz and Azpiliceuta. 

47: An early save from Cech as Willian gets away down the right-hand side, and produces a cross-come-shot that the Arsenal goalkeeper gets down low to save.

46: Arsenal get the game back underway at Stamford Bridge.

A change from Chelsea at the break with Tiemoue Bakayoko coming on for Pedro in the second half.

The Sky Sports expert is impressed by Arsenal so far. Maybe the absence of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil is a positive for them today?
"It's been a proper, disciplined away performance - and it's about time."


An odd end to the first half as Lacazette gives Luiz a little shove near the touchline that sends him tumbling into a pitchside photographer. While Luiz tries to check on the man he tumbled in to, he also feels some pain in his wrist but the Arsenal striker is over to check both are OK. 
In terms of the game, it's been an entertaining half although without goals. However, both sides have had a few chances to take the lead with the match nicely simmering in the 45 minutes. 
Could we see the introductions of Eden Hazard and Alexis Sanchez during the second half? Keep it here to find out, or watch live on Sky Sports Premier League.

45+2: Nearly a costly mistake from Mustafi as he goes up against Morata but fails to control a high ball, allowing the Chelsea striker to steal possession and race through on goal. 
But Monreal does superbly to nick the ball out from his path and back to Cech, who shows some superb control to get the ball down on the ground before playing out from the back.

45: Two minutes of added time at the end of the second half. 

The Arsenal bench can't believe they didn't take the lead there. At least Alexis Sanchez can see the funny side after showing some frustration by hitting David Ospina in the arm.

43: OFF THE POST!!! That should have been 1-0 Arsenal! Iwobi slides Ramsey through and he dances past Azpilicueta and Luiz before firing, but it smacks off the lower part of the upright. 
Lacazette tries to scoop home the rebound but his balance is all wrong as it loops wide.

40: It has to be said, this has been a very even match-up so far despite Chelsea shading the opening few minutes. No goals yet but it's been an entertaining game to watch. Will we see someone take the lead before the break?.

PIC: It's light cardigan weather for Arsene Wenger this afternoon.

Plenty for Frank de Boer and Palace chiefs - Steve Parish was watching from the stands - to ponder, though the beleaguered Dutchman - and the Sky Sports pundits - insist there were positives to take from that performance.
You'll find more reaction on Sky Sports News and skysports com but that's all from us. Thanks for joining us.

Let's hear from the Burnley boss, who's praised his side's resilience.

Sean Dyche, meanwhile, has revealed Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton could be sidelined for several months after suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder.
Heaton landed awkwardly on his shoulder after colliding with team-mate Ben Mee as he caught the ball in the first half at Turf Moor.
"Tom Heaton, it looks like a dislocated shoulder and if that is the case we are looking at months, not weeks."

More now from Frank de Boer, who insists his side controlled the game.

Some grim reading among these Opta stats for Frank De Boer and Palace fans

The full post-match interview from Frank De Boer coming up but here's a taste. 
"I think everyone watching could see only one team deserved to win today and that was us but that's football - sometimes you don't get what you deserved.
"We controlled the game but we can also blame ourselves for the mistake and for not taking our chances."

Let's hear from matchwinner Chris Wood and man of the match, James Tarkowski.

Jamie Redknapp: "Palace had so many chances - Benteke, Scott Dann - he could have had a hat-trick - and you felt second-half something was going to come. But they're lacking confidence and Burnley defended for their lives. James Tarkowski was brilliant."
Alan Pardew: "I thought Palace deserved a goal. You can look at a manager under pressure and say the team perhaps aren't working for him but they tried everything in the second half."

Miserable stuff for Palace, who didn't really deserve this defeat. Two off the line and an unbelievable miss from Scott Dann came after Chris Wood's opener, which was gift wrapped.  
Crystal
Palace became the first side in Premier League history to lose their first four
games without scoring. Stay tuned for highlights. 

90+2: Palace can't get out of their own half. Schlupp takes an age with a throw in. Wood wins it back and wins his team a corner. That should be that.

90: THREE MINUTES ADDED ON!

89: WHAT A MISS!!!! What has De Boer done to deserve this? Ward clips a fantastic ball to the back post and Dann is there, all of three yards out, to surely power home the leveller? NOPE! He somehow heads wide. Blimey. 

88: Puncheon gets down the left wing and is found by Cabaye. His cross is cleared behind by Tarkowski.
SHOT! Cabaye finds space on the edge of the box but his shot is a great height for Pope to punch clear. It's ALL Palace. 

86: SHOT! Townsend cuts in off the right wing and fires one towards the far corner. Mee deflects it wide. The corner comes to nothing. 

84: OFF THE LINE!! Palace denied again. A corner drops to Dann at the back post and he fires a cracking low effort at goal. It looks to be heading in but Tarkowski makes a sliding block and Burnley survive. 

81: SUB! McArthur is replaced by Riedewald while Defour comes off for Westwood. 

79: SAVE!! Best chance of the half. Benteke and Townsend link up superbly. The striker flicks his way through on goal and only has Pope to beat. The goalkeeper makes himself big and blocks the ball away. Benteke's frustration grows further. 

78: Finally a bit of sustained pressure from Palace. Benteke has an effort blocked away by Mee and then Townsend releases Lowton down the right flank. His low cross is a dangerous one but Burnley get to the first ball. Palace - and Benteke in particular - caught on their toes.  

76: YELLOW! A bad day gets worse for Benteke, who needlessly jumps into Tarkowski when the ball was gone.

74: SAVE! Burnley counter. Barnes finds space about 20 yards out and curls an effort towards the far corner. Hennessey reads it and palms it clear. That's the home team's second effort on target - but only one stat matters.

73: CHANCE!!! De Boer has his head in his hands. A corner drops at the feet of Schlupp about 15 yards out. He's got time to pick his spot but he blazes the chance miles over the crossbar. So poor.

71: CHANCE! Townsend checks back on the right and floats a lovely ball to the back post Lumeka makes a great run and gets there ahead of Lowton. He can only deflect the ball over the crossbar. 

68: Palace are lacking ideas. Dann comes forward but then sees no support. Two passes later and it's back with Hennessey, who has to start again. 

65: SUBS! Vokes is replaced by Barnes. Lumeka makes his PL debut for Lee, who has had a forgettable afternoon. 

64: COUNTER! Burnley break down the right with Lowton. He gets to the by-line but can't dig out the right cross. The ball comes back to him but he's offside. 


62: Townsend is Palace's only spark. He cuts in off the right and fires one. blocked well by Cork. He then sends a ball into Benteke but yet again Tarkowski is first there.

60: The first 15 minutes of this half have passed without an incident. Burnley happy to sit deep and soak up pressure while Palace are showing no incisive attacking play. Snoozy. 

57: Frustration starting to show here on the visitors. Benteke, who hasn't really been involved, looks for a ball over the top but doesn't get it. He throws his hands in the air in anger and gives Cabaye a stare.

55: Real lack of urgency here from Palace. Should they lose and fail to score today Palace will be
first side to lose first four PL games without scoring. They need a spark..

52: Townsend cuts inside and tries to get Palace going. Cork crowds him out as another attack fizzles out. 

50: Scrappy period this. Burnley fighting for every ball in midfield and Palace are struggling to get the ball into their main men. 

47: Schlupp makes yards down the left and fires a flat cross which is attacked by Benteke. He's about 15 yards out though and his header arrows well wide of the post.

45: KICK-OFF! We are back. No changes for either team. Can Palace respond?

Jamie Redknapp, watching in the Sky Sports studio, still can't believe that Chung-yong howler - but reckons Chris Wood still deserves plenty of credit.
"What is he thinking? It's a horrendous back-pass. But what I will say, is that Chris Wood anticipates it really well. It's a brilliant finish."


A moment of madness from Lee separates the teams. His woeful back-pass was seized upon by Wood, who netted on his home debut. Palace threatened early on but their attacks fizzled out. Still no goals for De Boer's men this season. See you in 15. 

45+2: SHOT! Townsend wriggles free about 25 yards out and takes aim with his right foot. Mee gets tight and takes the sting out of the effort. Pope makes an easy save.

45: Three minutes added on. 

43: Brady whips a free-kick from a dangerous area on the left. It's a tasty ball but Benteke shows his worth with a fantastic defensive header. 

40: Townsend fakes to go one way and then goes the other. He beats his man and looks for Benteke in the middle, but Tarkowski wins the first ball. More required from the Palace front man. 

37: First touch for Pope as Fosu-Mensah hits a poor diagonal straight into the arms of the former Charlton goalkeeper. 

35: INJURY! Heaton springs off his line to make a solid catch above Mee. He hits the ground hard, though. Immediately, he calls for the medics. Looks like a dislocated shoulder. Pope is coming on to replace him. His Premier League debut. 

33: Penny for Sakho's thoughts? He's not in the Palace squad as he's not quite match fit. 

31: POOR! Straight into the wall from Cabaye. He shakes his head. He knows he's better than that. 

30: FREE-KICK! Tarkowski is caught in possession and Palace counter. Cabaye drives towards goal and is fouled by Lowton about 20 yards out. Dead centre, this one. Cabaye eyeing it up..

28: Cheers from the home fans as Ward bundles into Vokes in midfield. Burnley have taken the sting out of Palace in the last 10 minutes.


25: Gudmundsson tricks his way down the right and swings a ball to the back post. Brady is charging in for the tap-in but Ward does brilliantly to get back and force the ball away. 

22: McArthur's effort from 25 yards is deflected behind for a corner - Palace's fifth of the game.
CHANCE!! Cabaye whips another sensational ball into the near post and McArthur times his run perfectly. His meets it with a firm header but it spins a yard wide of the post. Should have scored. 


FT: The referee blows the final whistle and Bournemouth hold on to secure an invaluable three points! First half goals from Surman and Stanislas were enough for the visitors despite Diouf's goal midway through the second half.

90+3: Is that the final chance of the game? Berahino receives the ball on the right but lashes an effort high and wide.


90: We are into added time now. Can Stoke nick a goal or will Bournemouth stand firm to secure a priceless victory? Shawcross has joined Crouch in a towering strike partnership for the final moments.

89: Another cross comes in and Choupo-Moting gets a touch on it but the ball runs away from him and into Begovic's arms with the pair coming together in a slight collision. Neither player is hurt, though and play resumes.

87: Chance! Stanislas is advancing forward and is dispossessed but the ball squirms out to Smith who fires a low shot towards the far corner that just drifts wide of the post! That would've sealed the points for the away side.

86: A third and final change is incoming for Bournemouth with Pugh on in place of Ibe, who looked bright in the first half but faded as the game wore on.


80: A last throw of the dice from Hughes as Berahino is on in place of Jese. Berahino is still yet to score for the club following his move from West Brom in January and now would be an extremely opportune time for him to open his account.

79: It is kicking off here and Allen is right in the thick of it! The Welshman clashed with Smith who was awarded a free-kick and then appeared to say something to the defender as he lay on the floor. Francis came charging over to shove Allen and for a minute it looked as though a melee would ensure but it has all calmed down.

77: No guesses for how Stoke's social media team saw that penalty incident.  In fairness, they might have a point.

76: There's another change coming up for Bournemouth with Lewis Cook, on a booking remember, making way with Arter on in his place in a straight swap.

75: Fletcher sends a hopeful free-kick deep into the penalty area and Francis only succeeds in looping a header into the air but Begovic comes out to scoop the ball up authoritatively to relieve the pressure on his defence.

72: Penalty call! Stoke are adamant that they deserve a penalty as a sliding Smith challenge sends Jese hurtling to the floor but Lee Probert is having none of it. Having seen three or four replays it is still difficult to see whether that was a foul or not.  Smith might have just got a nick on the ball but it was minimal contact if it was. A contentious one.

71: Not for the first time this afternoon Hughes is animated on the touchline and this time his wrath is directed towards his own player Pieters after he commits a foul deep inside Bournemouth's half. Hughes pointed to his head as if to suggest the Dutchman was lacking brain power.

70: Stanislas fizzes an in swinging corner into the box towards Ake but the Dutchman's header flies miles over the bar.

68: Allen has just
displayed a lovely bit of skill over on the right touchline. Firstly he sent
Lewis Cook for a hot dog with a deft swivel of the hips before nut-megging
Daniels in the same motion. Cook, clearly slightly embarrassed, races back to
take Allen out and he is cautioned for the foul.

Stoke are into 9/1 to complete the turnaround now and Crouch is 11/2 to strike.

65: Can Bournemouth weather the storm? Stoke have their tails up and for a second it looks as though Diouf has another opening as Choupo-Mouting lobs the ball into his path but the flag is raised to give Bournemouth some much-needed respite.

Stoke are right back in this game and it is their man of the moment Diouf who scored it to take him to three goals in as many matches. It wasn't a particularly memorable one as Choupo-Moting got something on a hopeful long punt upfield to bundle the ball into Diouf's path and he in turn used his thigh to divert it over Begovic. Game on!

60: In reaction to Crouch's introduction, Eddie Howe turns to his bench to bring on the towering centre back Steve Cook, who is on in place of Lys Mousset.

58: It's Crouchy time! Hughes turns to the veteran striker in a bid to salvage something from this game with Johnson making way. The early signs are that Crouch will partner Diouf in a two-man attack.

57: Surman, the standout player in the first half is down holding his manhood after receiving a hefty whack from Choupo-Moting right where it hurts! That looked a nasty one but the goalscorer is up on his feet.

56: You get the feeling that there are definitely more goals to come in this as neither side look particularly confident at the back. 
Stoke are in the ascendancy at the moment and Bournemouth will have to dig deep to retain their two-goal cushion.

54: There's a bit of indecision in the Bournemouth area as Ake heads a cross out for a corner despite Begovic coming out to claim it. 
Stoke have a corner but play is being held up as Shawcross and Smith had a little coming together with the referee looking to calm things down a touch.
In it comes from Fletcher and Choupo-Moting gets a head on it but it is whacked away for a throw-in.

51: Chance! Johnson has already created a chance for Diouf this half and he is involved again, picking out Allen inside the area but the Welshman fluffs his shot and it bobbles harmlessly wide. That was the kind of chance that Allen was gobbling up at the start of last season.

50: Butland makes a weak clearance that falls to Cook inside the centre circle but he opts against going for a Dejan Stankovic-esque shot from distance.
Butland is forced into another hurried clearance this time from a poor backpass and he just manages to get it away from Afobe who was bearing down on him.

48: Allen gets to the byline and stands up a cross to the far post but Fletcher and Pieters get in each others way somewhat and Bournemouth can scramble it clear.
Another cross is sent in this time towards Diouf who takes a poor touch that allows Francis to recover and make a vital last-ditch intervention. He was a little bit flat-footed there, Diouf and a good chance goes begging.

46: Fletcher gets the second half underway for Stoke who need a big performance to get anything out of this game. It will be one win in eight games for them if they are unable to turn this around.



HT: The half-time whistle goes and the home fans are not happy! A quickfire double from Bournemouth sees them go in at the break two goals to the good thanks to Surman's excellent finish on 16 minutes and Stanislas' penalty two minutes later. Butland made a brilliant stop to deny Ibe and prevent Bournemouth going three up before Choupo-Moting missed a gilt-edged chance to pull one back. 
It has been an entertaining half to say the least and with Stoke needing to attack in the second half we should be in for plenty more goalmouth action in the second period.

45+2: Jese finds himself in space and he looks up and picks out Johnson inside the area but he dallies on the chance and eventually slams a hopeful cross-shot into Daniels for a corner. The former Chelsea and Liverpool man has not been at the races this half.

45: Three minutes of time to be added on at the end of the first half. 

44: A dangerous position for Stoke here with Fletcher standing over a free-kick. He whips an inviting cross into the six-yard box and Shawcross gets a toe on it but he can't get it on target and it flies just wide! What a chance for the captain to make amends.

43: Bournemouth are threatening again through the lively Stanislas as he charges forward before releasing Afobe down the left channel. Bournemouth's No.9 dips inside and looks to have a shot on goal but it is diverted behind off a Stoke defender.

39: Chance! And at the other end Stoke should have equalised! Pieters floated a delightful cross into the box that was begging to be converted by Choupo-Moting somehow nodded it just wide! Better accuracy on that and it would've nestled into the corner as Begovic would have had no chance of getting there.

38: What a save! Stanislas slots an inch-perfect pass behind Stoke's defence into Ibe who cuts inside and lets fly with a low shot that takes a deflection of a Stoke defender and is somehow clawed away by Butland! A wonder save from the England international!

34: Chance! Jese releases
Diouf inside the area and he has a powerful shot towards goal that Begovic tips
over the bar! That was by far Stoke's best chance of the afternoon and given
his recent form you might've backed Diouf to score from that position.

33: Stoke are on the attack and Jese has a speculative effort from the edge of the area that loops comfortably into the hands of Begovic in goal.

32: Interestingly, Stanislas' successful conversion from the penalty spot was the eighth spot-kick that Bournemouth have scored since the start of last season which is higher than any other club in the division.

30: Just having a look at that penalty incident again which is an easy decision for the referee. Shawcross looked extremely rusty there as he was unable to sort out his feet at all before bringing Afobe crashing to the ground. Clumsy from the Stoke defender but atleast he wasn't booked for it.

Stoke are out to 10/1 for what would be a remarkable turnaround after a nightmare opening here. It's 5/2 that they score before half-time while Diouf is 7/1 to score next.

27: Lewis Cook lays a pass into the path of Smith but this time his cross into the box lacks accuracy and Stoke get it clear.
The ball is up by the halfway line and there's a coming together between Diouf and Francis that leaves the Bournemouth skipper down in a heap.

25: Surman has turned into Maradona this afternoon! He delivers a sumptuous out of the foot ball into the path of Ibe who flashes a cross into the box that just evades Mousset who was running in to meet it. Bournemouth are playing something scintillating stuff here.

23: I've just about caught my breath again after all that excitement! Bournemouth started the game on top but Stoke were just beginning to get into it before conceding two goals in as many minutes.
The first was a vintage free-flowing Bournemouth move while the second was a confidently dispatched Stanislas penalty. The visitors are now one goal away from matching their overall tally before the game.

20: It is all happening here! Hughes looks absolutely furious on the touchline but his side almost grabbed a goal back as Johnson sees a goalbound effort blocked behind by Daniels. 

Stoke are in a world of trouble now as Bournemouth have doubled their lead! Afobe wriggled clear of Shawcross inside the penalty area and was brought down by the Stoke skipper. Stanislas stepped up and confidently sent Butland the wrong way to double Bournemouth's lead!

18: Penalty to Bournemouth!

And slightly against the run of play Bournemouth are in front and what a lovely goal it was too! Smith made a lung-busting burst down the right flank and had the awareness to pick out Stanislas in the area and he laid it off to Surman who slid a beautifully well-placed finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. That was Bournemouth at their very best and Eddie Howe will be absolutely delighted!

14: For a moment it looks as though Diouf is in to score his third goal in as many matches as he closes down a Begovic clearance but the referee's assistant flags the in-form striker offside and it looks as though Begovic knew that was the case.

Not a good start to the season.

It's all over. Roy Hodgson manages a smile as he shakes hands with Jose Mourinho but there was very little for Palace to smile about today. 
They conceded in the third minute and never looked like getting back into the game. Easy street for Manchester United.
Stay tuned for highlights.

90+3: If it stays like this it will be United's fourth 4-0 win in the Premier League this season. They won't have many easier victories than this you'd think.

90: Three minutes of time added on.

89: Fellaini, looking for a hat-trick, almost manages to get on the end of a deep free-kick, but Hennessey is out and manages to claim the ball. 
Very comfortable for United in the closing stages.

There's a goal for Lukaku, his seventh of the season in the Premier League. It's an easy finish from close range as Martial gets in down the left and puts in a low cross for the striker to tap in.

83: United have scored quite a few late goals this season but at the moment it's all rather sedate. Palace aren't committing too many players forward and United look very comfortable.

81: CHANCE! Lovely play from United. It's passed into the midfield for Herrera, who picks out Martial's overlapping with a perfectly-weighted ball. The substitute drives in a shot which Hennessey saves well.

78: SHOT! Townsend goes for goal from a free-kick on the right side and almost finds the far corner. Just a few yards wide with De Gea scrambling across.

76: Final change for United as Mata is replaced by Herrera.

76: Is there a goal in this for Palace? They are playing on the front foot and creating openings around the box.

74: Finally Palace do make an attacking change as Ladapo comes on for his debut, replacing Sako.

74: SHOT! Lukaku controls well in the box and lays it back for Lingard, but he fires a first-time shot well over the bar.

72: A bright display from Rashford comes to an end as he is replaced by Martial.

71: CHANCE! What a chance for Lukaku. What a miss.
He's in on goal after the referee plays advantage for a foul on Lingard. It looks as though Lukaku will just roll a shot into the bottom corner but he goes wide. Poor finish.

Over 50 per cent of Sky Sports Fantasy Football bosses have Romelu Lukaku in their sides this weekend, but will he reward their faith? The joint leading scorer is 9/2 to score next and 9/4 to net anytime.

70: CHANCE! Palace are looking positive and Sako goes close as he sweeps a shot way over the bar from around the penalty spot.

69: Here's a change from Palace, two in fact. Schlupp is replaced by McArthur and Puncheon makes way for Riedewald. Not exactly attacking moves.

67: Palace looked as though they were going to bring on striker Ladapo, but not sure that is happening any more. Can they get a goal? It's really all they have left to play for in this game.

65: Rashford is fine to play on and United make their first change of the match as Mkhitaryan is replaced by Lingard.

63: The visitors have seen more of the ball in the second half but they haven't really threatened. 
Rashford has just gone down after being caught by Sakho. Oof, looks like he took a whack between his legs.

60: Palace's problem highlighted as Sako pulls out wide, looks up into the box and sees there is nobody there so decides not to cross and eventually gets tackled. 
Palace surely have to throw more caution to the wind soon.

58: SAVE! Mkhitaryan plays a quick corner to Young, who is in space on the corner of the box and gets off a low shot that Hennessey gets down well to save.

57: CHANCE! Sako gets into the right corner and manages to dig out a cross for Schlupp on the penalty spot. He goes with his head but can't direct the ball goalwards.

55: Palace enjoying a good spell of possession, but they are lacking in the final third. Sako has looked best when he has drifted out to either side.

53: Lukaku hasn't had any real chances but he perhaps should do better as he's played in down the middle and, rather than go forward, he cuts back and gets tackled.


Speaking on Soccer Saturday, Matt Le Tissier feels Palace were hard done by there.
"It looks like to a penalty to me. Mike Dean is having none of it. A small team at a big club, never going to get it!"

51: PENALTY? Huge appeals from Palace as Schlupp knocks the ball past Smalling in the box and goes to ground. Did Smalling stick out a leg? The referee says no penalty. 
Roy Hodgson has his head in his hands.

Just like last week at Manchester City, Palace have conceded quickly after half-time to surely end their chances of getting anything from the game. 
Rashford whips in a free-kick with pace from the left and Fellaini is ahead of his marker around three yards out and diverts a header in.

48: SHOT! Mkhitaryan's low cross from the right gets through to Rashford, who smashes in a shot that is well blocked.

46: Rashford has really given Ward a tough time. He again races away from him down the left before crossing towards Lukaku, whose shot deflects over.

The teams are back out. No changes for either side. United get the game back underway.

The Soccer Saturday Price Boost is currently 7/1 at half-time, with Manchester United two goals to the good but Leicester and West Ham level.
Back the Soccer Saturday Price Boost here.

Seems like Phil Neville is a fan of Fellaini..


And that is half-time. The scoreline is as expected, although Palace did well in patches after conceding such an early goal. They have a mountain to climb to get back into this though.

45: Just the one minute to be added on.

44: SHOT! What a goal this would have been. 
Mata lifts the ball from one side of the box to the other where Mkhitaryan has time to line up a volley. but he blazes it into the stands.

43: SAVE! Mata's cross from the right is flicked on by Lukaku and lands for Rashford at the back post. He takes a touch and then fires in a low shot which Hennessey saves well at his near post.

41: CLOSE! Mkhitaryan bends in a corner from the left and Smalling rises well at the back post but heads just wide. Should have scored.

40: Can United kick on and really put this game to bed? They have only had two shots on target but they have scored with both of them.

37: What a setback for Palace that is. They had been dealing well with United and even looking dangerous at the other end. A long way back now.

United weren't looking threatening, but they have just conjured a goal from nothing. Young curls in a brilliant ball from the left side to the back post, where Fellaini is open to tap in from a few yards out.
That's Fellaini's third goal in his last four home games.

35: After a very bright start, United have their impetus. It's all quite slow and without any real threat.

33: SHOT! Super first-time pass from Cabaye, sliding the ball through the United defence for Sako on the left side of the box. He fires a powerful effort towards goal but De Gea palms away.

32: This is the best spell of the match for Palace as Townsend does well to break a tackle and then win another corner. Cabaye puts in another good delivery but Fellaini heads away.

30: Palace are actually doing a decent job of keeping United at bay. They have also got some good crosses into the box, but United have defended them well.


FT: That's it. A thoroughly deserved first Premier League victory of the season for Newcastle, but winless West Ham were awful.
Rafa Benitez is the main man here, as Toon fans sing his name, and goals from Joselu, Clark and Mitrovic give them lift-off on their Premier League return. Matt Ritchie is man of the match. 

90+3: Terrific from Merino again to square for Mitrovic, but he blazes it over. 

90+1: Four minutes added on.

90: Corner to Newcastle, Murphy takes, but Clark gives away a free-kick. 

88: Newcastle change. Ritchie, who has been superb, is replaced by Murphy. 

A fine third goal for Newcastle! Perez's lovely touch allows Mitrovic through on goal.  he just has Hart to beat, rounds him calmly, and pokes it into the empty net.
Superb from Newcastle, but really poor from West Ham. That all came from a long punt upfield from Elliot.

86: SAVE! Merino plays a nice forward pass for Perez, who touches it on for Mitrovic to shoot, but Hart closes down the angle and saves well!

84: Lanzini has a go from a 30-yard free-kick, but it's poor, and well over the bar. Slaven Bilic looks despondent on the touchline.

81: Booking for Sakho after a meaty challenge in midfield. 

79: Newcastle looking for a third.  Hayden bursts into the box, squares from the left, but Ritchie can't collect as he slides in. 

77: CLOSE! The ball falls to Ritchie in the box, but Cresswell's out-stretched leg blocks it for a corner. Nearly a third.

75: St James' Park is a very happy place right now. They're singing Rafa Benitez's name in all four stands.

Clark is the scorer, but Ritchie is the architect. The Scot plays a one two near the byline after wrestling the ball off Cresswell.
As he gets the ball back, his first touch is superb, and the cross into the area is plum on Clark's head. He finds the corner of the net off the far post. Lovely header, and is that game over?

72: Goalscorer Joselu is replaced by Mitrovic for the final 20 minutes for Newcastle. 

71: Two changes for West Ham; Ayew and Noble come off, Kouyate and Sakho are on.

69: Fantastic ball from Ritchie to release Joselu down the left, with acres to run into as Zabaleta is caught out of position, but Joselu's touch is poor! 


67: Fernandes is booked for a foul in midfield on Mbemba. Second yellow of the game for West Ham. 

65: Hernandez gets a header on target from Ayew's cross, but it's too weak. Elliot easily collects. 

63: SAVE! Ritchie with a lovely nutmeg on Noble on the edge of the box, and he sees dollar signs. He should square for either Joselu or Perez, but goes for the bottom left corner, from 20 yards, and Hart tips it away well!

61: Newcastle currently camped in their own half, but have defended really well to keep West Ham away from their defensive third.

59: Hayden is down after being caught accidentally by Ayew, but he looks to be OK. The game has opened up a tad in the second half.

57: Lanzini's loose pass allows Newcastle through, and they have men over! They overplay the ball outside the box, however, as Joselu struggles to get possession back. Relief for West Ham and Lanzini. 

54: CLOSE! So close for West Ham! Ayew releases Cresswell down the left.  he lines up a fierce effort, Elliot can only beat it into the path of Hernandez, but he can't shuffle his feet to get a good enough effort on goal! Newcastle eventually clear off the line!

53: Big decision for referee Neil Swarbrick. Hernandez is very late on Lascelles with a nudge, similar to the first half booking, but the referee gives him a stern talking to, rather than a second booking.

51: Ritchie never needs much of an invitation to shoot.  he has a go from 25 yards, but it's a few yards wide of goal. 

49: Hernandez looks frustrated up top. It's been long ball after long ball so far, and he nudges Lascelles to give away a free-kick in a desperate attempt to get to a loose ball. 

47: Joe Hart asks a lot of Ogbonna with a short pass, and it runs out of play. 
SAVE! Hart is then tested by Perez as his cross-shot is parried clear of danger. From bad to good by the England goalkeeper.

46: Back underway in the second half here. Lanzini is on for West Ham, replacing Declan Rice, the youngster who gave the ball away for the only goal of the game.

The new signing has Newcastle ahead here


HT: That's the half. Newcastle deserve to be in front, but it hasn't been the greatest of encounters.
Harsh lesson for Declan Rice, who gave the ball away in midfield, allowing Atsu to square to Joselu. A happy St James' Park at the break.

45+7: Atsu races forward and has a pop from 25 yards.  Hart gets down well to his left to save. 

45+6: Joe Hart kicks the ball into the back of Ritchie, who had jumped in front of him as he booted it out of his hands. It bounces wide.

45+5: Better from Declan Rice, he concedes a corner at the byline from Atsu's run. Ritchie takes, Hayden heads on, Perez recovers it, but his cross is too close to Hart. 

45+3: Another Noble corner, but Newcastle clear yet again. They've defended very well so far. 

45+1: Six minutes added on after the injury to Ayew earlier in the first half. 

45: Just after the goal, Joe Hart rushed out to young Declan Rice to gee him up, a word of encouragement in the ear after his mistake. However, it looked like the 18-year-old didn't need telling, and could have done without Hart's input.

43: Joselu nods on a long ball for Perez, he's at an acute angle, and can't get a strong shot on goal. Hart gathers. 

41: At the other end, Merino has a go from 20 yards, Hart slightly fumbles it, but recovers it eventually before Joselu can close in. 

39: Noble corner from the right, and Lascelles is all over Collins in the box. The ref doesn't spot it, and play goes on. West Ham furious. 

Finally, we have a goal in the Premier League! Young midfielder Declan Rice sloppily loses out around 40 yards from his goal.  Perez feeds Atsu through on goal, with Joselu running beside him to his right.
Hart comes out, Atsu squares it, and Joselu bundles it home for a goal on his full debut!

35: Defences really on top here. It's not necessarily lacking in attacking quality, but this has the feel of a real nervy encounter. 

32: Some head tennis in the area, as the ball falls to Cresswell on the half volley at an angle, but he slices it over Elliot's bar. 

30: Ayew turns on the edge of the box and looks for the far corner, but it's awful, and into the stands. Not a great start to this game. 

28: Manquillo's wayward cross nearly heads for the top corner, but misses it by about half a yard. Joe Hart was clutching at thin air, there.

26: After a lengthy delay, and some work done to Ayew's nose, he's up and walking, and will change his shirt before coming back on. Five-minute delay there.


24: Ouch. Looking at the replays, Ayew's sliding tackle on Merino resulted in the midfielder's boot hitting the West Ham man in the face. Painful. 


FT: What a week for Oumar Niasse. He's come to Everton's rescue, scoring twice off the bench to seal a 2-1 victory. The win relieves some of the pressure on boss Ronald Koeman as Everton end a run of three straight defeats in the league to move up to 13th.

90+5: YELLOW! Stanislas goes into the book.

90+2: Pickford races out to punch Stanislas' free-kick clear. It's a crucial intervention from the England U21 goalkeeper. 

90: There will be FOUR minutes of added time.  

88: CHANCE! Kenny's cross picks out Calvert-Lewin, who fires over the crossbar from close range.

86: What a difference a couple of goals make, The home fans are chanting Niasse's name.

83: SUB! Mousset replaces Ake as Bournemouth make their final change.

Davies' shot deflects off King as the ball soars into the air. Niasse is there at the far post to tap home from close range and complete the turnaround.

80: YELLOW! Niasse slides  in and catches Ibe to pick up a yellow card.

79: SUB! Cook replaces King for the visitors. King looks like he's picked up an injury.

The subs combine as Davies fires the ball into the path of Niasse. The striker takes a touch before smashing the ball past Begovic for the equaliser.

76: SUB! Everton make their final change as Martina is replaced by Kenny. 

74: SUB! Defoe is replaced by Afobe for  the visitors. 

73: Martina swings a long ball into the box but there's too much height on it, allowing Begovic to come off his line to make a clean catch.

70: OFF THE LINE! Let off for Bournemouth. Williams wins the first header and Holgate helps the ball on towards goal. Luckily for the visitors Surman is there to hook the ball away to safety.

68: PENALTY? Calvert-Lewin drives into the Bournemouth penalty area. He's shoulder to shoulder with Ake as both players go to ground. Everton want a penalty but the referee waves away the appeals.

65: The home side are becoming more and more frustrated. King goes down holding his hip but the referee stops the game thinking it's a head injury. It;s a decision that has not pleased the home fans.



62: Niasse holds the ball up well before playing the ball back for Baines. He whips a cross into the near post for Sigurdsson, who cannot direct his header on target.

61: SAVE! Gosling cannot quite get enough on his shot to trouble Pickford, who makes a comfortable save.

59: Ibe gets a shot away from the edge of the penalty which is deflected wide. Bournemouth are looking a real threat so far in the second-half.

56: YELLOW! Davies is straight into the action sliding in and catching Surman to pick up a caution.

55: SUBS! Changes for Everton as Davies and Niasse replace Klaassen and Rooney.

53: Ibe skips past Williams initially but the Everton defender recovers well to block the cross with a sliding challenge.

51: SAVE! Bournemouth break again as King slides the ball through for Defoe. The England striker looks to pick out the bottom corner but Pickford is quickly off his line to make a crucial block.

Bournemouth strike on the break. Daniels slips the ball to King, who skips past the challenge of Holgate before firing  a low shot right into the bottom corner.


46: Everton get us back underway at Goodison Park.

HT: Plenty of possession for Everton but they have nothing to really show for it as the teams go into the break locked at 0-0. Let's hope for a better showing, and goals, from both sides after the break.

45+1: Rooney's back for Everton. It's another change of shirt for th former England captain.

45: There will be ONE minute of added time.

45: CORNER! Everton are still down to 10 men as Pickford punches Stanislas' corner clear. 

43: The blood is again pouring from Rooney's face. He trots off for more medical attention but it looks like he'll have to have a few stitches at the break.

42: Defoe stands a cross up to the far post. Stanislas is charging in to attack the ball but Martina stands his ground, heading behind for a Bournemouth corner.

41: CHANCE! Sigurdsson's cut back picks out Rooney on the edge of the six yard box. It's a great chance for Rooney, but he gets his shot all wrong, slicing the ball wide of the target.

39: Rooney finally returns to the action to give Everton their full compliment of players.

38: Rooney is still off the field as Sigurdsson over-hits a free-kick Goal kick to Bournemouth.

36: Rooney is currently off the field receiving treatment for the cut near his eye.

34: There's blood coming from the face of Rooney. He's not happy and gestures to the fourth official that he's taken an elbow from Francis after they challenged for the ball in the penalty area  The replay shows the former England captain is caught by a stray arm but it doesn't look deliberate.

32: Gosling dwells on the ball giving Gueye the chance to try and win it back for Everton. He slides in but just gets the timing of his tackle wrong, giving away a free-kick deep inside the Bournemouth half.

29: Everton have been dominant in terms of possession so far but there has been a real lack of quality in the final third from both sides.

26: Daniels is allowed to run into the Everton penalty area but he produces a poor pass, which is easily cleared by Williams.


24: Schneiderlin wins the ball back for Everton high up the pitch before laying it off to Baines. The full-back whips in a low cross towards the penalty spot but Bournemouth clear their lines.

21: Martina plays a low cross in from the right but the ball is intercepted by Surman.

19: BLOCK! Everton break quickly through Calvert-Lewin. who picks out Sigurdsson 20 yards from goal. The Iceland international lays the ball off for Calvert-Lewin but his ball is brilliantly blocked.

16: SAVE! Stanislas drives a low shot goalwards from 25 yards which is easily saved by Pickford.

15: YELLOW! Schneiderlin slides in and catches Surman to pick up the game's first yellow card.

13: CORNER! Another dangerous delivery from Sigurdsson is punched clear. Everton recycle the ball though as Williams' shot is deflected into the arms of the Bournemouth goalkeeper.

OK everyone, that is all we have time for I am afraid from the John Smith's Stadium after Huddersfield's first-ever Premier League win at the stadium!

Rafa Benitez says he is upset with Newcastle's 1-0 loss to Huddersfield..

David Wagner said he was delighted with Huddersfield's performance against Newcastle this afternoon.

Aaron Mooy said Huddersfield must work hard to keep improving, while Tom Ince said his side deserved their 1-0 win against Newcastle.

PIC! Huddersfield boss David Wagner shows his delight after his side's 1-0 win against Newcastle today.

Excluding the debut season of the Premier
     League in 1992/93, Huddersfield are the first team to win their opening
     two games in the competition.
Newcastle, meanwhile, have lost their first
     two games of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 1999/2000.
The Terriers are the second newly-promoted
     team to keep a clean sheet in their first two Premier League games
     following promotion (after Charlton in 1997/98).
Newcastle have now gone 12 away games without
     a win in the Premier League, losing 10 of them (D2).
Huddersfield’s opener – scored by Aaron Mooy -
     featured the most passes in the build-up of any goal scored in the Premier
     League so far this season (14).



PIC! Huddersfield's players celebrate their 1-0 win against Newcastle this afternoon, their first home victory in the Premier League that sees David Wagner's side move up to second in the table.


Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Smith (7), Billing (7), Kachunga (7), Mooy (8), Lowe (8), Van La Parra (7), Ince (7), Mounie (7), Zanka (6), Schindler (7)
Subs: Palmer (6), Quaner (6), Hefele (NA)
Newcastle: Elliot (6), Clark (6), Lascelles (6), Gayle (5), Ritchie (6), Hayden (6), Perez (5), Mbemba (6), Manquillo (6), Merino (7), Atsu (6)
Subs: Murphy (6), Diame (6), Joselu (6)
Man of the match: Aaron Mooy

FT: It is all over then at a rocking John Smith's Stadium, which has just witnessed it's first-ever Premier League goal and win as Huddersfield deservedly beat Newcastle 1-0 thanks to Mooy's brilliant 50th-minute strike.

90+2: SUB! Hefele now comes on for Ince as Wagner makes his final change to try and waste some more time at the end of the game.

90+1: YELLOW! Lascelles gets a late caution for catching Mounie late with a flaying arm.

90: The fourth official says we will have an extra four minutes to play at the end of the second half.

88: YELLOW! A late booking for Mounie for catching Clark with a flying elbow, although that was slightly harsh on the striker as that was clearly accidental.

Jamie Carragher: "He was the best player in the first.  he hasn't had as much of an impact in the second but the standout moment of quality in this match has come from this. The first top flight goal at home for 45 years."

86: Huddersfield earn themselves a corner down the right, which they take short to try and waste some crucial time at the end of this game, and they manage that quite successfully..

Jamie Carragher impressed with new Newcastle signing Joselu so far: "He's certainly added something, Joselu. There's not a lot he can do with that ball coming into him, but he's done well to hold off the Huddersfield defenders, and Newcastle have fed off that. A big difference to Dwight Gayle."

84: Newcastle hoist a high ball into the box for Joselu, who rises to get his head on the centre, but the Spaniard cannot do anything with it as his flicked effort sails into Lossl's hands.

81: Brilliant last-ditch block by Lowe as Murphy raced through on goal, albeit at the expense of a corner.
However, nothing comes from the resulting corner as the home side clear their lines.

80: SUB! Murphy comes on for the disappointing Perez as Rafa makes his final change of the afternoon.

79: More than 24,000 in at the John Smith's today, which is  a record attendance for a football game at the ground.


77: YELLOW! Palmer gets booked after catching Lascelles late as the defender cleared his lines.

76: SUB! And one of those changes sees Diame come on for Hayden for the final quarter of an hour.

75: More changes are afoot for Newcastle as they look for an equaliser..

Jamie Carragher: "There's always alive Huddersfield, especially on the second ball. The crowd completely energises them and they get up!"

73: Billing strides forward down the left after playing a neat one-two with Ince, with Manquillo left trailing in his wake, before curling in an inviting ball that just evades his team-mates waiting in the middle.

71: SUB! Huddersfield swap the impressive Kachunga with Palmer.

69: SUB! Huddersfield now bring on Quaner for Van La Parra.

69: CHANCE! From the left-wing corner Clark flicks the ball on the near post for Perez, but the striker volleys over the bar from just six yards out. Will the visitors get a better opening today?

68: SAVE! Newcastle spring to life as Joselu works some space in the area and gets off a low shot that Lossl is forced to turn behind for a corner.

66: YELLOW! Billing now gets booked for pulling back Atsu.

64: YELLOW! Joselu's first involvement in the game is to get booked for following through late on Lossl.

63: A half chance for Newcastle as Merino releases Manquillo down the right side of the box, but his pull back is straight at Lossl.


60: An hour gone then at the John Smith's and as things stand, Huddersfield are deservedly leading this game 1-0.

He'll remember this one for a while, and so will the Huddersfield fans.



58: This will be interesting to see how the visitors now respond to the setback of falling behind..

56: That goal, understandably, brought the house down at the John Smith's, which is now absolutely rocking.

53: YELLOW! Hayden goes in the book for a late tackle on Billing.

52: SUB! Rafa reacts to that goal by bringing on new boy Joselu for the disappointing Gayle.

Jamie Carragher on the gantry: "The best player on the pitch in the first half, plays a lovely one two, and doesn't blast it. He just looks up, and guides it into the top corner. We've been crying out for this in the game. No panic, just composure around the box."

WHAT A GOAL! They have been waiting 45 years to see a top-flight goal at the John Smith's and boy has the wait been worth it as Mooy plays a neat one-two with Kachunga in the box, before curling a delightful effort past a helpless Elliot and into the top right-hand corner of the goal from just inside the area.

48: Both sides have started the second half sloppily, giving away possession needlessly and that has, in many ways, been the story of the match so far.

46: OK we are back underway again after half-time, with Newcastle re-starting the game playing from left to right in the second half.



PIC! As expected, there has been very little to chose between the two newly promoted sides in the first half at the John Smith's.


FT: That's it! Dire for an hour, but goals from Jay Rodriguez and Peter Crouch means this ends one each. Baggies will be unhappy with that, considering the mix-up at the back with Hegazi and Foster.
Highlights in 15 minutes.

90+4: McClean takes a cross early on the left, Rondon also takes it early on the volley, in an awkward position, and he can't quite sort his feet out. Out for a throw eventually. 

90+2: Sobhi gets down the right, his cross is cleared to Fletcher, but the midfielder's half volley is blocked. 

90+1: Four added minutes for someone to find a winner. 

89: Final Albion change. Here comes Oliver Burke for his debut, as goalscorer Jay Rodriguez is replaced. 

87: CHANCE! Stoke nearly ahead! Shaqiri's delightful ball falls to Choupo-Moting at the far post, and his effort is deflected just wide! 
Jay Rodriguez heads away Shaqiri's corner, and West Brom eventually clear danger. 

86: Zouma lets fly from miles out, looking to cut across it and move it from left to right, but it's a couple yards wide of Foster's right-hand post.

85: Rondon goes in heavy on Fletcher, who is in a heap on the floor. Very clumsy, and a deserved yellow. 

84: Allen makes a good run inside the box at an acute angle, he's found by Shaqiri, but his cross-shot his beaten away by Foster.
At the other end, a fine ball from Brunt meets Rondon, but he can't get over it and heads well wide. 

83: Barry with a dink over the defence looking for Rondon, but Shawcross superbly heads back into Butland's hands. 

81: Dawson uses his body well to usher Crouch out of the way. It looks like Stoke might be going for the three points.

79: Who goes for the victory now then? Stoke have done very little and are lucky to be level, but then again Albion haven't exactly wooed us. 

Wow. West Brom have absolutely gifted Stoke an equaliser here, and it's a howler from Hegazi. 
Sobhi sticks a nothing ball into the box with the outside of his boot, Foster rushes out and makes the call to collect ahead of his team-mate Hegazi, but the defender sticks a leg out, and it deflects into the path of Crouch to head into an empty net. 
Bizarre goal, and Foster is absolutely furious. Tony Pulis will be too.

75: Another Baggies change. McClean is on, Phillips makes way. 

73: Butland races out to collect a long ball, but it slips out of his hands and he concedes a corner. Uncharacteristic from the England goalkeeper.
OFF THE BAR! From a corner, the ball loops up to Rodriguez at the far post, and his own looping header hits the top of the crossbar. Butland had it covered, however. 

71: Changes here. Morrison is replaced by Yacob for Albion; Cameron is off for Sobhi for Stoke.

69: Lovely play by Barry to calm the midfield and bring the ball out under pressure, but he then needlessly pokes it out of play.

67: Stoke play around with it on the edge of the box, Choupo-Moting has a go, but Dawson blocks it. West Brom break and have men over, Livermore finds Rondon, but he's a few yards offside! 

65: SAVE! Free-kick to Albion, around 40 yards from goal. Great ball in from Phillips, Hegazi attacks it well, but Butland tips it over the bar!



63: Change for Stoke.  Crouch is on, Jese comes off. West Brom will guard this with their lives now, and Hughes wants to put some height in the box.

Finally, a chance, and a goal! Nyom, who has been superb, is deep on the right and puts in a lovely cross.  it bounces once, finds Rodriguez free at the far post, and he heads it past Butland!
That's his first Premier League goal for the Albion since his move from Southampton. 

59: Barry cuts out a Stoke attack just as Choupo-Moting pounced upon a ball given away by Livermore. Barry has had a fine game so far.

57: West Brom fans are urging their team to push forward and make something happen. 

55: The first half is very much like the first. Both defences on top at present.  will one of these managers turn to their bench before long?

52: Boos ring around the Hawthorns. that's because Saido Berahino is warming up for Stoke. The former Baggies man isn't popular here. 

50: Corner to Albion. Phillips delivers, but Pieters clears. It's back out to Phillips, but he's offside.

48: Rodriguez, playing off the left, cuts inside and looks to get into the area, but he's crowded out by three Stoke shirts.

46: Back underway at the Hawthorns.
Oliver Burke was out training at half-time with his new team mates. Will we see him in the second half? This game needs an injection of pace.

Allan Nyom hasn't been happy at times in that first half and he's a 9/2 Price Boost (from 7/2) to be carded in the second half.
0-0 is now just a 5/2 chance with 1-0 West Brom - their result in each of two games so far this season - now at 4/1.

HT: That's the half. Really not one to write home about, so far, with both defences firmly on top. Nyom has been excellent for Albion, but nothing happening in the final third for either side. 

45+1: One minute added on.

44: Phillips takes, right-footed to the near post this time, but Pieters clears. Stoke break, three on three.  Shaqiri feeds Jese, but he slips and hits it wide from an acute angle. Good defending from Nyom. 
Moments before there was a penalty call as the ball hit Brunt on the arm from a deflected shot, but it would have been harsh. 

42: Decent ball in from Brunt, it misses Rondon but falls to Phillips at the far post, he sticks it back in first time, but Shawcross clears for a corner. 

40: Stoke are knocking it about in midfield, but West Brom are so, so organised. It's quiet at the Hawthorns, and you can hear Craig Dawson shouting to bring his defence up and down the pitch as Stoke penetrate. 

38: West Brom free-kick on the right. Brunt with another deep one, Dawson clatters into Butland and he fumbles it again. Foul this time, however.

37: Dawson does well to win a corner with a turn in the box. Brunt delivers to the back post again, Butland fumbles it slightly, but Stoke get it away. 


35: Stoke break, the first real opportunity for either side to counter attack. Jese collects it in space from Fletcher's switch, he runs at Nyom, and he gets a bit of help from Morrison before ushering out the Spaniard. Good defending. 

33: Nyom looks to turn the ball around the corner past Pieters, the Stoke man flies in and catches him, and that's the first booking of the game. 

31: Nyon sticks out an arm as Jese approaches, Jese goes down like a sack of spuds and Stoke players surround the referee. Foul given, nothing more. And rightly so. 

29: Martins Indi with a ball in from the left, Choupo-Moting rises, but he glances it well wide. 

26: Bizarre, bizarre situation here.
Just as Shaqiri runs up to take the corner, ref Anthony Taylor (with his eyes on the penalty area, not on Shaqiri) blows his whistle to signal that the corner can be taken. 
However, all the players in the box think Taylor has blown for an infringement. Cameron doesn't even attempt to go for the ball, nor do any of the other players, and it goes out for a goal kick to West Brom. Bemusement all around!
A case of bad timing for Taylor, and Shaqiri being a tad too keen to take the corner before the whistle was blown. 

Pretty even so far and so no surprise to see the draw shorten to 7/4. West Brom to win and under 2.5 goals in the match is a Price Boost which could tempt some after this start - that's 3/1 from 11/4.

25: SAVE! First opportunity of the game.  Zouma piles forward, has a go with his left foot, it deflects off Barry but Foster dives to stop it looping over him!

23: Really nice from Barry again, straight into Rondon's feet, but he can't hold it up this time as Stoke recover.

Choupo-Moting's protestations were in vain - ref Anthony Taylor shrugged off his tumble over Chris Brunt's boot. Might have had a card for making a meal of it, himself, the Stoke man.

20: Lovely from Barry, pinging a 50-yarder to the feet of Phillips. Unfortunately, the winger can't get a decent ball in and it hits the side-netting.

18: Ball into the box by Nyom.  it looks quite dangerous, but Butland rushes out well to collect as Rondon fails to wrestle away his marker Shawcross. 

16: Stoke have had more of the ball, 67 per cent, but it's been fairly even in terms of action in both halves so far.


A superb afternoon for Man City, but not so much for Stoke and the hosts have zoomed to the top of the Premier League table. 
There were six different scorers for the hosts, with Gabriel Jesus the only player to score twice, and his 17th minute opener was swiftly followed by Raheem Sterling (19). David Silva added the third in the 27th minute to see City race into a 3-0 lead.
Stoke looked to be building some kind of fight back around half time as a Mame Biram Diouf (44) scored the first for the hosts just before the break, and was involved again as a Kyle Walker own goal (47) added a second for Stoke after the restart. 
But the brief blip only seemed to spur Man City on as they netted their next three goals in six minutes, with Jesus adding his second (56) before Fernandiho (60) and Leroy Sane (62) got in on the scoring action and Bernardo Silva (79) rounding off the rout. 
Man City now go two points clear at the top of the Premier League table after Manchester United's goalless draw with Liverpool earlier in the day while Stoke slip down to 15th.

90+2: First yellow card of the game for Afellay as he commits what can only be described as a rugby tackle on Sane, pulling the Man City man down by his legs as he tries to get away. 
A clear foul and a booking.

90: Three minutes added on.

88: CLOSE! Man City could really have done with that goal.  Or maybe not. It's still a superb chance for the hosts though.
Bernardo Silva sets Sterling away down the right flank and he cuts back to David Silva at the top of the box. He has options but goes for goal himself, but his effort just skims past the bottom corner. 

84: What a performance this has been from Man City, who have completely dismantled Stoke this afternoon. They had a brief glimmer of hope around half time but they have been outdone by real class.
A break in play now as Walker goes to ground after a challenge from Diouf.

Another great goal for City, and you cannot deny that each of these seven goals have been of the highest quality. 
Sterling is involved again as he picks out Bernardo Silva in the middle of the box and the midfielder simply slots home past Butland. 
There could yet be more goals in this.


76: City are seeing plenty of the ball - as you would expect - as Silva tries to do a Fernandinho and score from distance but it flies high over the crossbar. 

73: A superb goal from Fernandinho this afternoon, but he makes way for Yaya Toure. 

71: CLOSE! Nearly another goal for Stoke as Shaqiri finds Cameron at the top of the box. He takes one touch before going for goal but it just clatters into the side netting. Not far off from the defender, though.

69: A quieter few minutes at the Etihad although Stoke have seen some of the ball with a throw-in. However, they could not make their advantage count. 

66: Another City change as Gundogan comes on for De Bruyne, who has been simply superb today.

65: In the aftermath of the goal, Jesus was replaced by Bernanrdo Silva.
CLOSE! Nearly another for City and Sane as he delivers a corner, but it can only find the outside of the netting although it looked in to some in the ground!

Oh my.  Can anyone keep up with these guys?! It's another superb goal for City who make it six. 
De Bruyne picks up the ball near the half way line, powering forward before picking out the run of Sane towards the back post. The German makes no mistake in tapping home with his first touch, under the body of Butland, who has no chance to save that really.

What. A. Goal. There have been so many goals this afternoon, but that is the best so far. 
From a corner, Delph taps the ball into the feet of Fernandinho at the top of the box. He sets himself up before striking and it is a thunderbolt effort that smashes into the back of the net via the underside of the crossbar.

59: Deep free kick to City as Delph is fouled by Diouf. They play it between themselves in their own half as they look to make an opening, and they do. 
Sterling bursts away down the right flank, putting a great ball into the box but Zouma is there ahead of Jesus to clear.

Pieters has had an absolutely abysmal afternoon and he is once again beaten as De Bruyne bursts away down the right flank before delivering the ball into an almost empty box.
Jesus is waiting - unmarked - for the delivery and fires home with his first touch to restore Man City's two-goal lead.

53: A horrible end to Edwards' debut and he looks distraught as he is stretchered off. He is applauded off around the ground before Sobhi comes on in his place. 

51: Free kick to Man City as Fletcher clips Fernandino on the edge of the box. Silva takes from the top of the box but it flies wide.
Meanwhile, Edwards is down with what looks like an ankle injury. He had gone to ground before the free kick but got up again as it was taken, but is now chatting with the medical staff.
It looks like another change is imminent.  


Well well well, what do we have here?! Stoke have struck again at the start of the second half and they are suddenly just one behind. 
It's a superb cross from debutant Edwards on the right flank, finding the head of Diouf in the middle of the box. However, his effort is heading wide before it deflects into the back of the net via the post from the thigh of Walker. 

46: Stoke get the game back underway and they've made two half-time changes. 
Afellay and Martins-Indi are on for Jese and Wimmer.


A goal-laden first half at the Etihad Stadium as Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling and David Silva found the back of the net. 
Mame Biram Diouf netted the reply for Stoke just before the break but they have plenty more work to do if they truly want to get back into this one.

45+2: SAVE!! Brilliant save from Butland as De Bruyne lets fly from the top of the box with a superb shot, but the Stoke goalkeeper makes a great, leaping save to deny City another first half goal.

45: Two minutes added on.

Dare I say it, but game on?..  Stoke have had two chances and they score with the second. 
Diouf does well to get past Fernandinho on the right flank, powering into the box with his cross for Jese clipped back into his path by the forward. 
Fernandinho tries to stop Diouf again but his sliding challenge merely lifts the Stoke man's shot over the head of Ederson and into the back of the net.

43: SAVE! Another from Butland as Sterling and Silva link up down the left flank before the latter tries to shoot, but the Stoke goalkeeper reads it well and gets down low to push the ball away with his foot. 

41: NEARLY! A nervy moment for Butland there as Sterling tries a cross-come-shot from deep on the left, but the goalkeeper is down low at his post to push it away. 
Wimmer is also there and just nicks the ball away from the goalkeeper who is forced to chase down the ball before booting it away under pressure from Silva. 

39: Not a bad effort from City once again as Sane whips a ball into the box from the right flank, with Silva racing into the box to try and poke home but he just misses it as the ball runs wide. 

37: As you might imagine, City are just knocking the ball between themselves at the moment. Sterling and Sane have also switched flanks. 
De Bruyne tries to put the ball back into the area from the right, but it bobbles and allows Butland to collect.

34: SHOT! Stoke have their first shot of the game! Finally. 
Zouma collects the ball in the middle of the park and surges forward, taking on the shot himself from around 20 yards, but it flashes wide of the post. 

33: Free kick for Stoke deep in their own half as Choupo-Moting is fouled by Sterling. However, very little comes from it as the ball runs wide down the touchline despite Diouf's attempt to get there.

31: More pressure from City as they win a corner as Walker's pass for Sane is put behind by Edwards. They cannot make anything from it this time, though.

Well, you can only watch on in amazement at how good this City side is. It's another brilliant goal from the hosts. 
Jesus finds Sane down the left-hand side of the box, with the German in turn picking out the run of Sterling on the other side of the area. 
But the England man does well to notice Silva almost unmarked in the middle, clipping the ball back into his path. Silva takes one touch before slotting home through two Stoke defenders and under the body of Butland. 
Double figures anyone?.

25: CLOSE! Nearly a third for Man City as Silva and Sterling link up down the right flank, and the latter puts a ball into the box for his captain with a nice one-two. 
Silva tries to get the ball under control but some good defending from Choupo-Moting sees the ball out of danger. 

23: Stoke have barely seen the ball at all since kick off, and I can't say this has changed much since the two goals. It could be a long afternoon for Mark Hughes' men.



Another sumptuous goal for the hosts and they are 2-0 up within mere minutes. 
Sane sets off the move himself, finding De Bruyne at the top of the box who returns the ball to his team-mate through the middle of the box. 
Sane takes a few touches before spotting Sterling near the back post, and the England man makes no mistake in popping the ball home, past Butland and Pieters on the line.

It has been coming and City finally make the breakthrough with a superbly worked goal. 
De Bruyne slots a ball into the feet of Walker from the right flank, with the defender making a brilliant, gut-busting run from the halfway line to be involved.
Walker then taps the ball towards Jesus in the middle and despite Diouf trying to stop him, the striker taps home. 

16: SHOT! Not a bad effort at all from Delph there who powers an effort towards goal from range, but Butland makes a strong saves.

15: CLOSE! Another good chance for City as Sterling gets away down the right flank with Pieters' attempted challenge leaving the Stoke defender on his bum before Sterling whips the ball into the box. 
It's searching for Jesus but Zouma does well to clip the ball away from danger before it can reach the striker.

13: A corner to City as Fernandinho's pass finds Sane down the left hand side, getting past young Edwards, before the hosts win the set-piece.
Not too much comes from it initially, but Delph delivers another ball into the box that Otamendi just heads wide.

11: Another chance for City - does anyone feel a pattern forming here? - as Jesus finds himself in across of space in the middle of the park, picking out Sterling along the right-hand side of the box.
He tries to slot the ball to someone in the box but it flashes past everyone and goes wide.

9: WHAT A MISS!! How has Sane missed that?! It is all set up so well for the German as De Bruyne fires a superb ball into the box from the right flank, with Wimmer's half-hearted clearance seeing the ball land to Sane just behind him. 
The City forward has all the time in the world to set himself up and he looks to be in the perfect position - but his eventual shot lashes high and wide over the crossbar from close range. City should be ahead here.

7: What an absolutely superb ball from Otamendi. He picks out Sterling on the right flank who appears to be free, but Pieters also does well to read his movements and closes him down as Otamendi's pass arrives with the ball eventually going wide.

5: SAVE! Good early save from Butland - he might need to make a few of those today. It's Sane who gets away in the middle of the park, tapping to Sterling on the right who is once again in the thick of the attacking action for City. 
Sterling then cuts out three Stoke defenders as he tries to slot the ball into the feet of Sane in the middle but Butland is there to collect.

3: Man City have seen the better of the ball in the opening exchanges and they looked to have created a good opening as Sterling got away down the right flank, but his attempted cross was blocked by Pieters. 




Swansea: Fabianski (6), Mawson (5), Olsson (6), Naughton (5), Bartley (6), Fernandez (5), Carroll (6), Fer (5), Mesa (5), Ayew (5), Abraham (6) Subs: Narsingh (4), Routledge (4), McBurnie (4) Man Utd: De Gea (7), Bailly (8), Jones (7), Blind (7), Valencia (7), Matic (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Pogba (7), Mata (7), Rashford (7), Lukaku (7) Subs: Martial (7), Herrera (4), Fellaini (4) Man of the match: Henrikh Mkhitaryan

United looked for a set for a tense final 10 minutes at the Liberty Stadium, having failed to add to Bailly's opener. 
However, two exquisite assists in two minutes from Mkhitaryan allayed any lingering fears. 
The first, a disguised reverse pass, presented Lukaku with his first clear sight of goal from which he rifled home United's second, before the second, a deft through ball, was lofted beautifully over the Fabianski by Pogba.


The award went to Mkhitaryan, who provided two second-half assists today, taking his tally for the season to four from two games.
He told Sky Sports: "It was a tough game in the first half against five defenders. We were patient and we knew what we had to do. 
"The second half was easier because they started playing with four defenders. The team spirit is what we need. We are having a little bit of luck and we are scoring the chances we are creating."

Pogba just told Sky Sports: "The game was a very good result, a 4-0 again. We have to carry on like this. This season we are more confident, everybody knows each other very well."
On his two fouls in the first half, he said: "The first one is a yellow card. The second one, no. I was not worried. The referee came to talk to me and I laughed with him, I said 'Are you serious?'"

A second straight 4-0 win for Manchester United, who scored three late goals in four minutes to put Swansea away here.
Eric Bailly gave them a first-half lead before goals by Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial sealed victory in the final 10 minutes.

90: THREE minutes of added time at the Liberty.

87: United are heading for back-to-back 4-0 victories to open their Premier League season. Ominous.

85: SUB! Ander Herrera replaces Mkhitaryan. Two assists for the Armenian international today.

This is absolutely ruthless from United, three goals in four minutes.
Pogba tees up Martial, who drives into the Swansea box and picks out the bottom corner of Fabianski's net with a calm finish.

And there's the third! Mkhitaryan is again involved with a brilliant assist for Pogba, who follows Lukaku's lead, lifting his finish over Fabianski.

That should wrap up the victory for United - and it's another goal for summer signing Romelu Lukaku.
Martial has looked lively since coming on, he finds Mkhitaryan, who provides the assist for Lukaku with a lovely pass. 
The Belgian takes a touch, steadies himself, and lifts his finish over Fabianski.

80: United 10 minutes away from another clean sheet. They look pretty comfortable at the moment, with most of the play in Swansea's half.

77: United now have Fellaini, Matic and Pogba in central midfield. Fair to say they should win the aerial battle.

74: Pogba takes and it's a decent effort, curling about a yard over the crossbar.
SUBS! Here come the United changes as Mata and Rashford are replaced by Fellaini and Martial.

73: YELLOW! Fer catches Blind as the defender was firing on goal from 25 yards and it will be a United free-kick in a very promising position.

72: CHANCE! The corner is whipped in and two Swansea players dangle a leg out but neither make contact. Abraham was closest. That was a let-off for United.

70: Olsson gets forward and his cross is deflected for a corner. Swansea are just growing into this second half now and Mourinho is preparing a double change.
It will be another corner as Matic heads over his own bar under pressure from Fernandez.

Marcus Rashford is a current in-play Price Boost to score the next goal - he's 11/1 from 9/1 to do so.

66: Another half-chance for the hosts. Ayew gets a pocket of space and darts down the left, producing a great cross that flashes across the six-yard box. Abraham was on his heels there.
SUBS! Narsingh replaces Mesa and Routledge comes on for Bartley. Swansea will go to a back four now.

62: Mkhitaryan tries his luck from 25 yards and it takes a deflection off Fer, flying out for a corner. Blind takes the outswinger and Matic gets there first but Swansea smuggle the ball clear.

61: CHANCE! Better from Swansea! Carroll overlaps on the left and drills a cross into the box. Bailly and Jones have gone to sleep and Abraham has plenty of space but he can't direct his header on goal. It's an awkward height and the striker's header goes over.

60: It can't be long before we see a Swansea change. Routledge and McBurnie are on the bench.

56: Matic leads a United break, finding Mata with a neat pass. He helps the ball onto Rashford, who cuts inside Naughton and tests Fabianski with a snap-shot from the edge of the box. The Swansea goalkeeper gets his body behind it.
The hosts look bereft of ideas in attack. How they could do with a player like Gylfi Sigurdsson.

54: The game has just become very scrappy in the last few minutes. Rashford gets a chance to run at Naughton but Fernandez doubles up and Rashford fouls the latter.

50: Mawson makes a crucial interception from Mata's cross to deny Rashford at the near post. The corner is then cleared easily by Swansea but they can't make the ball stuck up front. United take control again.

48: Olsson gets a rare opportunity to get forward but, with Abraham waiting in the box, the left-back badly over-hits his cross. Goal kick to United. Swansea need more in the final third.

46: The visitors get us back under way for the second half. No changes at the break.

The Frenchman was booked for a trip on Carroll and then went in late on Olsson minutes later. Should he have been sent off for two yellows?
In the Sky Sports studio, Thierry Henry said: "I think it's a foul, yes, but not any more than that. You can see he's trying to get the ball, he's a bit late, but I don't think it is a second yellow."

United have been chopped into 1/10 for the win following that late first-half goal. Swansea are 40/1 to turn things around in the second half - they did win from a goal down in this fixture two seasons ago.
Half-time Price Boosts include Lukaku to score the next goal at 9/2 (from 7/2), Pogba to score at any time (9/2 from 4/1) and Bailly to be carded (5/1 from 4/1).

United lead at half-time thanks to Bailly's opener. Swansea will feel slightly hard done by after playing well for 44 minutes but a lapse in concentration from a set-piece has cost them.

United make the breakthrough and it's Eric Bailly!
From the corner Pogba rises well and plants a header goalward. Fabianski makes an unbelievable save, tipping the ball onto the crossbar and down onto the line. 
Bailly reacts quickest to turn it in.

44: Pogba whips in two excellent crosses in quick succession but yet again Swansea defend them well, Naughton clearing the second out for a corner.

42: WIDE! Fabianski makes a mess of collecting a looping cross into the Swansea box. Mata is alive to the chance and pokes it goalward but it goes a few yards wide. Olsson did just about enough to challenge the Spaniard. 

39: Rashford is dispossessed by Ayew, who then does well to win a free-kick from Mkhitaryan. A chance for Swansea to deliver.
CHANCE! Mesa swings it in and it's a free header for Bartley! He tries to knock it back across goal but gets too much on it. He needed to go for goal himself.

36: CHANCE! Huge opportunity for Rashford! Mawson's blind header back towards his own goalkeeper puts Rashford through on goal but he goes for the chip and Fabianski reads it. He stands up and catches the effort.

34: CLOSE! Bartley rises above Bailly from the corner but he can't direct his header on goal and it drifts wide. Paul Clement will be very satisfied with Swansea's performance so far.

33: Swansea are defending doggedly but all United's play is coming through the middle at the moment. It is making it easy for Swansea's back three to keep it tight. United will want more width.
The Swans then break clear through Ayew, who looks for Abraham in the centre but Bailly defends well, conceding a corner via Jones.

30: Pogba is on the stretch after Lukaku's deflected pass and the Frenchman goes in late on Olsson. Moss calls him over for a chat but no second yellow. Pogba needs to calm himself down.

29: Rashford take a pot-shot from fully 30 yards out and that's easy for Fabianski. The United forward is cutting a frustrated figure.

In the match betting, there's little change with United at 2/5 and Swansea 8/1 for the win.

26: YELLOW! Pogba crashes in late on Carroll and that's a booking. Silly by Pogba.

25: Jon Moss calls Rashford over for a quiet word. The United forward complained again to the referee after he was taken out off the ball by Fernandez. He probably had a point but Moss isn't having it.

22: Bartley shows great pace to keep up with Rashford and make a crucial tackle on the young United forward, who appeals for a free-kick. Rashford felt his shirt was pulled but nothing given. Excellent defending.

19: Fer's touch lets him down and the Dutchman takes down Matic. A free-kick for United midway inside the Swansea half. They take it quickly and the cross comes in from Blind. Swansea will defend those all day, headed away again.

18: Swansea relieve some pressure when Matic needlessly fouls Ayew. United look very narrow in attack, with Rashford and Mata tucking in to support Lukaku and Mkhitaryan in the middle too. It seems a little crowded.

16: Almost a first chance for Lukaku at the far post but Mawson defends well to head clear Rashford's delivery. Still all United at the moment.

Well, have you heard, the Premier League is back. What a night. Shall we do it all again tomorrow? Ok. 
Until then.

Short and sweet from Arsene Wenger, he's clearly chuffed with his side's display. We await Craig Shakespeare.

“It’s a long time since we’ve had so much quality. Giroud
is in his prime and is at the top of his game. So, yes, we have quality.” 

“Giroud is fantastic. I opened the door for him. I didn’t
want him to go. He wanted to stay and that was one of the greatest days I’ve
had in recent months. There is no chance he could before the window closes. It’s
a determined no.”

"Every game he is stronger. Overall he is adapting slowly
to the way we want to play. He’s a collective, intelligent player."

Wenger has arrived in the press room deep in the bowels of the Emirates, and he's his assessment of a thrilling game.
"We kept going, our spirit was absolutely outstanding. Overall we
were punished with every mistake by Leicester. We had 70 per cent possession with 27
shots on goal. Leicester had three on target and scored three, that’s how
efficient they were. That was a top quality game. If you want the Premier League
to be the best league in the world, you need games of this quality."

Here's what Arsene Wenger had to say about the match-winner to Sky Sports.
"I love the man and the player
because he is a fantastic guy, he loves the club and he does not want to leave
and I am happy that he wants to stay.
"But at some stage I opened
the door for him because I knew that I had many strikers, but he is really
loved here and we really love him and in the end he decided to stay."

Arsenal's Olivier Giroud says his side kept the faith as he scored a late winner for the Gunners.

“Giroud can’t be Arsenal’s number one
striker as that wouldn’t be enough if Arsenal are trying to win the Premier
League. But there is so many strikers down the years who have played major
roles as a back-up. He’ll get you 15 goals a season.” 

Arsene Wenger and Craig Shakespeare are currently fulfilling their post-match media duties with TV and radio broadcasters but we're in place to bring you best of their conferences with the written press. Stay tuned, I'm informed they'll be with us shortly.


Jamie Carragher thinks Mike Dean got a big call wrong with Arsenal 3-2 down. Mesut Ozil seemed to handle the ball in the build up to the goal.
Carragher said: "Unfortunately, we’re talking about
referees again. It’s a blatant handball. I gave Mike Dean the benefit of the
doubt in commentary, but he’s got to get the decision right." 




Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech has given his reaction to Gary Neville and Kelly Cates on the pitch at the Emirates.
"We are not happy with the goals [conceded], but overall we showed great character. It was the first game of the season and it was a classic for everybody to watch. It must have been amazing to watch."

"Wow. What a night. Talk about players needing pre-seasons  this is our first game and I'm absolutely shattered just watching that."

Wow! What a game! I cannot think of a more fitting way to usher in the new Premier League season. A seven-goal thriller. Football is back with a bang! Mike Dean brings an end to a thrilling game which was won by strikes from substitutes Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. Leicester played their part, as did Arsenal's leaky defence, but in the end the Gunners dug deep to kick their campaign off with a victory.

90+4: YELLOW! Morgan catches Giroud with a high challenge and picks up a booking late on.

90+3: Great defending from Monreal to keep Leicester at bay. Iheanacho looks to thread Vardy through on goal but the Spaniard reads the situation well, intercepting before releasing Ozil high up field.

90+1: Into FIVE minutes of added time at the Emirates.

89: CHANCE! Arsenal have the chance to wrap up the game as Schmeichel races off his to clear a long ball. A quick throw leaves the Foxes stopper exposed, but Xhaka can only fire a long-range effort wide.

87: SUB! Third and final change by Leicester as Demarai Gray replaces Marc Albrighton.

"How vital could this goal be? There's nothing the goalkeeper can do! There's talk of this man leaving the club  no chance of him going anywhere if i was the Arsenal manager."

Incredible! Absolutely incredible! The two substitutes sent on by Arsene Wenger score a goal apiece in two minutes to spark scenes of delirium inside the Emirates. Olivier Giroud rises highest at a corner and heads the ball over the line, via the crossbar, with goal-line technology confirming the goal. 

"We talk about his ability to score goals from midfield.  What a first touch. What a finish. He's brave and arrows it right in the far corner."

Cometh the hour, cometh the man. He's scored so many important goals for Arsenal in recent years and this is right up there as Aaron Ramsey controls at the far post and drills the ball beyond Schmeichel. Game on!

80: As Arsenal pile forward in attack, Vardy gives them a warning of the danger Leicester pose on the counter, racing deep into Gunners territory before being outnumbered and dispossessed.
81: SUB! Second change for Leicester as Matty James makes way for debutante Kelechi Iheanacho.

79: Arsenal continue to patiently work their way forward and they create a decent opening as Xhaka plays the ball into Oxlade-Chamberlain's path, but the midfielder's horribly sliced effort just about sums up the Gunners' evening.

77: So Arsene Wenger has played his cards, can his players deliver before full-time? The Frenchman has cut a frustrated figure on the bench this evening, and even ventured to the edge of his technical area just now to rally his troops.

74: Much to the annoyance of the Arsenal faithful, Ozil lashes the ball into side-netting having been presented with a sight of the Leicester goal.
74: SUB! Third and final change for Arsenal as Theo Walcott replaces Danny Welbeck.

72: SUBS! First change for Leicester as Daniel Amartey replaces Shinji Okazaki.

71: If Arsenal are going to get back into this game you sense it's going to be through Lacazette - the man is on fire. Having plucked the ball down out of the air with one touch, the Frenchman picks out Ozil on the edge of the area, but his shot is blocked. 

Alexis Sanchez has been watching on from the stands, as his side trails with 20 minutes to go.

70: Lacazette breaks down the left again and delivers another good cross which finds Xhaka, but his volley into the ground is comfortably saved by Schmeichel.

68: CHANCE! So nearly the perfect introduction for Ramsey as he gets on the end of Lacazette's cross but heads wide from eight yards. It would have been a carbon copy of the Welshman's FA Cup final winning goal, but his header drifts agonisingly wide.

66: SUBS! Arsene Wenger has been forced to react, bringing on Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud for Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding. The Gunners boss clearly going for it!

64: Kelechi Iheanacho has just been ushered back from his warm-up - is the striker's Leicester debut imminent?

61: WHAT A SAVE! Stunning play from Welbeck and his plays a one-two with Elneny on the edge of the box before slipping a sublime ball in behind for Bellerin. The Arsenal right-back looks certain to score, but Schmeichel produces a fine, sprawling save to preserve Leicester's lead.


59: CHANCE! Arsenal finally showing some fight as Welbeck breaks down the right. His ball inside finds Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose rasping drive it too hot for Schmeichel to handle. The ball then drops for Lacazette but his follow up is ruled out for offside.

"Typical Arsenal. Nobody goes and attacks the ball. Nobody is brave enough to attack the ball.
"Jamie Vardy is not the biggest of players, but he's been on it all night."

It was only a matter of time before this Arsenal backline were punished but I have to admit I didn't see it coming from a corner. Mahrez whips the ball into the near post where Vardy steals a march on Monreal and glances the ball into the far corner. Arsenal's defence is a shambles!

55: SAVE! Cech to the rescue for Arsenal again as he tips Mahrez's fizzing 18-yard drive over the bar. What is going on at the back for the Gunners?

"There's no way an Arsenal defender is going to catch Jamie Vardy. We saw that from minute one tonight. Great anticipation from Petr Cech."

52: CLOSE! Arsenal work the ball nicely up until the final third where an aimless pass surrenders possession. One pass then dissects the Gunners defence as Mahrez runs clean through on goal, but Cech races out of his area and wins the ball with a sliding tackle.

50: Leicester string several passes together before a looping ball over the top finds Mahrez, who had evades the offside trap. The Algerian fails to make the Gunners pay though, lashing his cross-come shot out for a throw-in.

47: Arsenal work their way out of a hold deep inside their half as Oxlade-Chamberlain and Welbeck combine in the tightest of spaces, but James is on hand to prevent Welbeck from racing into the Leicester half.

46: Fuchs pumps a long throw into the Arsenal area which Maguire tries to get on the end of, but Welbeck is there to break up play before the hosts eventually clear their lines.

KICK-OFF! Leicester get the second half underway!




FT: Leicester beat Swansea  2-1 at the Liberty Stadium to hand Michael Appleton a win
his first game in temporary charge of the club this afternoon.
The visitors
took a 25th-minute lead when Swansea centre-back Federico Fernandez
headed Riyad Mahrez’s cross past his own goalkeeper, before Shinji Okazaki
doubled their advantage four minutes after half-time.
However,
despite the home side reducing the deficit thanks to Alfie Mawson’s excellent
finish (56), Leicester held on to end a run of six Premier League matches
without a win.
As a result,
Leicester have moved a point above their opponents into 13th in the
table thanks to their first away win in the league since April.

90+4: SHOT! Late pressure by the Swans, but as the ball drops nicely to Carroll just inside the area, the midfielder blazes high over the bar.

90: The fourth official says we will have four extra minutes to play at the end of the second half.

89: SHOT! Leicester now break up field, only for King to place a shot from the edge of the area high over the bar.

88: SHOT! Good break down the left by the Swans as Ayew then finds Routledge, but the sub's driven effort hits the side netting.

86: SUB! Leicester now bring on Gray for the outstanding Mahrez.

86: SAVE! Ayew now tries to beat Schmeichel with a low effort from 25 yards out, but it is too close to the Dane.

85: Iborra deflects Ayew's shot behind for a corner, but the Foxes back line hold firm to head the danger clear.

82: Swansea are now leaving huge holes at the back as they go in search of an equaliser, and Leicester are sure to get some chances now on the counter in the closing stages.

80: Wonderful sliding tackle by Carroll to dispossess the fast breaking Mahrez, and boy did the home fans enjoy that effort by the midfielder.

78: SUB! Swansea bring on Routledge for the hugely disappointing Sanches.

76: SAVES! Mahrez slips Vardy through one on one with Fabianski, but the Pole stands up tall to make a vital close-range block and keep his side in this contest.
And from the rebound, Mahrez tests the Swans No 1 at his near post with a low shot.

75: A quarter of an hour to go then at the Liberty - can the Foxes hold on to record what would be a huge win?

72: Leicester have done well to just take the sting out of the home side after Mawson pulled that goal back.

70: Twenty minutes left to play then as Appleton closes in on a win in his first game in temporary charge of the Foxes.

68: SUB! Appleton makes his first change of the game as King replaces Okazaki - a defensive move that by the caretaker Foxes boss.

67: SHOT! Naughton cuts in from the right flank, but the right back predictably blazes well over the bar.

65: Leicester have responded well to the shock of conceding that goal out of the blue, winning a succession of corners, with Mahrez showing some sensational close control just now down by the right-hand byline to bring a dropping ball out of the sky.

62: Swansea have enjoyed a whopping 70 per cent possession so far in this second half - what a turnaround hey? 


60: A worry for Swansea with striker Abraham down at the moment clutching his leg.

57: SUB! Swansea immediately bring on Dyer for Narsingh.


Swansea are back in this game as from Narsingh's left-wing corer, Ayew flicks on at the near post and Mawson does brilliantly to swivel and turn, before hoking the ball into the far corner of the net for the centre back's first league goal of the season.

54: SHOT! Narsingh cuts in from the right wing, but his effort on goal rises high over the bar.


51: That offside call was so close, but I think the referee's assistant just, just got the decision right, with Mahrez fractionally onside in the buikd-up to the Foxes' second goal.

Leicester double their lead on the counter as Vardy's chipped ball to the far post picks out the unmarked Mahrez and his pull back is tapped in by Okazaki from three yards out, with Swansea's players all appealing for offside. But to no avail..

48: Ayew's surging run towards the box is ended by Vardy's illegal tackle, handing Swansea a free kick near the right edge of the box, but it comes to nothing.

46: SUB! OK we are back underway again after half-time at the Liberty, with the Swans having made one change at the break, with Ki replacing Britton.


HT: The half-time whistle goes at the Liberty and Leicester lead 1-0 at the break thanks to Fernandez's 25th-minute own goal.
But make sure you all join us again shortly for what should be an intriguing second period.

45: The fourth official says we will have just one extra minute to play at the end of the first half.

43: A bit better this in the last few minutes by the Swans, albeit without actually testing Schmeichel in the Foxes goal.

PIC! Leicester 'keeper Schmeichel shows his delight after Fernandez's own goal gave his side a 25th-minute lead at the Liberty.

40: Sanches rolls around on the floor after a tackle by Iborra, but the midfielder then jumps up after not being given the free kick!

37: Naughton's shot from the right edge of the area is deflected over his own bar for a corner by Maguire.
However, Schmeichel is alert at the near post to deal with Narsingh's deflected cross from the left-hand byline.

34: Leicester are oozing with confidence at the moment, passing the ball around with flair, while Vardy is running the channels brilliantly in attack.

32: SHOT! Sanches tries his luck from distance, but the Portuguese's effort is high, wide and handsome.

30: Half an hour gone then at a rain-swept Liberty and the mood among the home faithful is bleak at the moment.

27: You cannot say that Leicester do not deserve to be ahead in this game, such has been their dominance in this first period.

Leicester take a deserved lead as Mahrez picks up possession of the ball near the left-hand byline, before the playmaker cuts back inside and drills a cross into the six-yard box where the unfortunate Fernandez stoops to clear, only for the centre back to inadvertently head the ball past Fabianski.


23: SHOT! Good ball in from the left is flicked goalwards by Abraham, but the striker's effort is well saved at the near post by Schmeichel.

21: CHANCE! Swansea win a right-wing corner that just evades Abraham in the six-yard box, before almost ending up in the back of the net off Morgan at the far post.

19: CLOSE! Simpson curls a lovely ball in from the right for Ndidi, but the midfielder does not make good enough enough contact at the far post, although Leicester still win another corner after a goalmouth scramble involving Fernandez and Okazaki.

18: SAVE! Meanwhile, Leicester break up field, with Vardy now testing Fabianski with a well-struck effort from about 25 yards out, with the Pole turning the shot over for a corner.
Nothing materialises from the resulting set play as Swansea clear their lines.

17: Free kick drifted into the six-yard box by Sanches from near the left-hand touchline, but it is too close to Schmeichel, who punches the ball clear.

15: YELLOW! A quarter of an hour gone then at the Liberty and it has been one-way traffic in the Principality as Fuchs, meanwhile, picks up a booking for pulling back Narsingh on the halfway line.

13: Vital block by Fernandez to prevent Albrighton's drilled effort from the left edge of the area from testing Fabianski after the midfielder was found by Vardy.


That's it, Burnley earn a point! Chris Wood's late, late goal extends Tottenham's wait for a Premier League win at Wembley.
They have won just two of 12 matches at this stadium. Not good.

90+3: SUB! Davinson Sanchez makes his Tottenham debut. He's just come on after that Burnley equaliser.

Burnley have done it! What a finish by Wood! Brady picks out the striker with a lovely through ball - Trippier goes to sleep - and Wood lashes low past Lloris.
Spurs just can't get a win at Wembley. Burnley have probably deserved that too.
A superb strike by Wood on his first Premier League appearance for his new club.

90+2: Brady weaves in off the right flank and goes down in the penalty area but it was a well-timed challenge by Davies and referee Lee Mason plays on.

90: FOUR minutes of added time.

87: SUB! Harry Winks comes on for Eriksen.

87: CLOSE! Ward gets free for Burnley again down the left but fails to find Wood with a good ball. The Clarets striker had held his run and was on the penalty spot, but the cross was just too far in front.

85: CLOSE! Ward delivers a peach of a cross but Vertonghen does superbly to clear under pressure from Barnes. A second ball then comes into the middle and Wood makes contact with a header but it's weak and Lloris gathers.

84: We are inside the final 10 minutes at Wembley. We've had plenty of chances in this second half but just the one goal. Will Tottenham get nervy in the final stages? Now's the time for Burnley to press.

81: CHANCE! Wood times his run to perfection but Lloris is alert to the through ball and races out of his goal, making a firm tackle on the edge of the area. He wins the ball cleanly and Spurs clear. What a let-off for the hosts. If Lloris got that wrong, he was off.

79: It is Kane with the free-kick in the end but it strikes the wall and Burnley clear. A disappointing effort.

79: SUB! Burnley will make a change before the set-piece. Ashley Westwood replaces Defour.

78: Alli dances away on the edge of the Burnley box and wins a free-kick in a very promising position. This could be perfect for Eriksen. Or will it be Kane.

76: SAVE! Heaton again! Eriksen fires a cross back towards Alli, who turns on goal with a volley but Heaton is well-placed to claim.

75: CHANCE! Another opportunity for Kane. He races away from Tarkowski but Heaton spreads himself well to deny the Tottenham striker. The chances are coming for the home team now.

74: CHANCE! Sissoko and Eriksen combine again but the latter gets caught in two minds. Sissoko lifts a ball over the top for Eriksen, who gets his volley all wrong. It seemed like he decided against the volley at the last second but couldn't re-adjust.

73: SAVE! The second corner is cleared initially but Sissoko finds Eriksen in loads of space on the right of the area. The attacker takes a touch and Heaton flicks over his stinging drive.

Dele Alli is an 11/2 Price Boost (from 5/1) to add another goal in the closing stages here.

72: SAVE! Davies picks out Kane with a lovely low cross but the striker's sweeping first-time effort is tipped wide by Heaton. Good stop. The resulting corner by Eriksen is cleared for another.

71: SAVE! Brady forces a good stop from Lloris! The Burnley winger drags the ball onto his weaker right foot and tests the Spurs goalkeeper with a fierce drive towards the near corner. 
The resulting corner is flicked well wide at the far post.

69: SUB! Moussa Sissoko comes on for Tottenham, making their first change. He replaces Son.

66: A few more signs Burnley are coming to terms with the game now. They are pressing Spurs again and putting a few more crosses into the box. You sense Tottenham may need a second goal just to feel comfortable.

64: Ward launches a long throw into the Spurs area towards Wood but the hosts defend it well.
Tottenham break through Davies but a solid challenge by Tarkowski upends Kane. The Burnley man had to time that right and did.

60: Burnley are trying to play a more expansive game and they have enjoyed a little more of the possession since the goal. But that may play into Tottenham's hands, they certainly have the players to counter.

56: SUBS! Dyche responds to the goal with a double substitution. Club-record signing Chris Wood comes on for Vokes. Ashley Barnes is also on, replacing Gudmundsson.

53: CHANCE! Kane goes close! It's just not happening for him in August! The ball breaks to the striker in the box and you expect him to sweep home, instead it goes the wrong side of the post.

52: Let's see if that goal brings Burnley out. The Wembley crowd is in full voice now, with a rendition of 'Oh When the Spurs. '

There's the breakthrough! The ideal start to the second half for Spurs.
Mee gets into a tangle trying to clear a corner, which was flicked on by Dier, and when Alli's initial effort is blocked, he reacts quickest to calmly finish on the rebound.
Dyche will be disappointed to have conceded from a set-piece. Mee won't want to see that again.

48: Alli looks to wriggle free in the box but Ward sticks to his task and wins the ball. Burnley have set out their intentions again, they are defending their 18-yard box.

46: We are back under way for the second half.

Spurs are out to 2/5 to win this one at the interval. Burnley remain available at 12/1 to win, just as they were prior to kick-off.

A frustrating first half for Spurs, who have failed to create much against a stubborn Burnley defence.

45: ONE minute of added time.

44: Brady whips the ball into the area but Spurs clear easily at the near post. Not a great delivery from the normally reliable winger.

43: Perhaps a late opportunity for Burnley in the first half. Vertonghen makes a mess of a bouncing ball and Arfield wins a corner.

39: CHANCE! Nearly for Kane! Alli turns well and feeds Davies on the overlap and he fires a cross into Kane. The Spurs man does well to control and tries to shoot low on the turn but Tarkowski is there to block. Superb defending.

38: No August breakthrough for Harry Kane - yet.

36: Better from Spurs as Eriksen chips up to Son, who nods down to Alli, and his strike is deflected out for a corner.
Eriksen takes for the hosts but Vokes clears for Burnley.

34: Burnley are doing an excellent job of restricting Tottenham to shots from distance and even then, Mee and Tarkowski are putting their bodies on the line to block. No real clear-cut opportunity for the hosts yet.

Meanwhile, Burnley are into 10/1 for victory having frustrated Spurs so far.
Click here for all the latest in-play betting.

33: Dier's low cross into the middle is cleared for a corner by Tarkowski. It doesn't go short this time, Son delivering, and the second ball falls to Vertonghen on the edge of the area.
His drive takes a looping deflection and Heaton does well to collect, preventing a corner in the process.

31: A needless push by Alli in the Burnley box relieves a little pressure that was building on the visitors. Spurs are in danger of getting a touch frustrated by Burnley's defensive tactics.

26: Burnley get a corner from nothing as a hopeful long ball forward brushes Trippier on the way out. 
The delivery is floated to the back post again - and again Tarkowski is free but he goes for goal rather than nodding it back into the six-yard box. Wrong decision. Goal kick to Spurs.

24: Davies goes in late on Gudmundsson in midfield and referee Lee Mason has a word with the Spurs defender. No booking. The Burnley man needs treatment but will be fine to continue.

22: Burnley are camped on the edge of their own 18-yard box, a dangerous tactic but a tough one to break down. Kane tries to spin Mee in the area and wins a corner.
They work it short very well but when the second ball comes into the middle from Eriksen, Dier heads over.

20: OFFSIDE! A great pass by Vertonghen gets Son in behind the Burnley defence but the forward's shot is kept out by Heaton at the near post.
It would not have counted anyway because the flag was up against Son, but the replay shows he was clearly onside.

18: Gudmundsson fouls Alli midway inside the Burnley half and this is an opportunity for Eriksen to deliver. 
CHANCE! It's actually Davies who takes the free-kick and it is swung outwards towards Kane at the back post but the striker nods over. He should have done better.

15: And Burnley look a threat on the counter. Brady skips away from Eriksen and looks for an unmarked Vokes in the middle but the Irishman's cross is a little too close to Lloris, who gathers.

14: Burnley's shape looks solid in the early stages here, they are making it difficult for Tottenham to break them down. Every time the hosts get possession, they are faced by 11 bodies behind the ball.




90+3: HOW DID THEY NOT SCORE! A Bournemouth corner breaks down and Spurs break with four on one! 
YELLOW! Begovic tackles N'Koudou just outside the box and the referee awards a Spurs free-kick and hands Begovic a yellow card.

90+2: SUB! Georges-Kevin N'Koudou comes on for Dele Alli.

90: Three minutes of added time here at Wembley.

90: WIDE! A strong run by Sissoko finishes with him crossing to Alli who bravely commits to a near-post header, but he nods it wide and takes a boot to the face from Francis.

89: Eriksen tries to pick out Alli at the far post but Ake blocks Alli off enough to allow the ball through and out for a throw.

87: A great block by Cook to deny Dier hands Spurs a corner. Trippier's cross is caught by Begovic.


84: YELLOW! For Vertonghen after he cynically pulls down Ibe.


80: GOOD STOP! From Begovic who excellently parries away Eriksen's shot from the edge of the box. Begovic has had an excellent game this afternoon.


75: SUBS! For Tottenham, Moussa Sissoko comes on for Heung-min Son.
And two attacking subs for Bournemouth, as Jordon Ibe and Jermain Defoe come on for Lewis Cook and Adam Smith.

72: Some lovely combination play between Stanislas and King on the counter-attack but the move ends up breaking down on the edge of the Tottenham box. Bournemouth are still posing a real threat on the break.

68: GOOD DEFENDING! By Sanchez who blocks out King who looked set to pull the trigger.

64: SCUFF! Dier cushions his header down for Kane, but his audacious attempt on the volley ends up slicing out for a throw-in.

61: DOUBLE SAVE! Tottenham really should have made it two there but for some fine goalkeeping by Begovic! 
Kane breaks through Bournemouth's defence but his shot is blocked by the Bosnian. 
The rebound is then squared by Alli back to Kane and Begovic is there to make the stop!

59: Good pressure from Smith on Vertonghen forces Spurs into conceding a corner.
Stanislas curls an outswinger.  but Trippier heads away at the near post before Kane boots clear.

58: NO GOAL! Kane nods in Trippier's cross but he's standing in an offside position. 

56: A disappointing cross from King on the left flank as he looks to pick out Gosling near the penalty spot, but it goes out for a goal-kick.


54: Alli's cross looking for Kane is too powerful and too high before going harmlessly out for a goal-kick.

52: OFFSIDE! Dier tries to find Son with a forward pass, but the South Korean is a step ahead of the play. Spurs are looking far more proactive than they did in the first half.

49: CLOSE! Tottenham are quickly looking to double their lead! Winks whips a cross into the box which Begovic has to punch away. Tottenham have really stepped it up a gear.

47: Spurs have taken the lead! Some uncharacteristically poor defending by Bournemouth as Eriksen easily skips by S Cook's weak challenge before he curls the ball into the bottom corner of the net. Spurs in front!

46: And we're back underway for the second half!


HT: A quiet first-half at Wembley where Bournemouth have had the better chances so far. Kane came closest to give Tottenham the lead with a relatively tame shot so we go into half-time goalless. Second half to follow shortly.

44: Vertonghen tries to work some space in Bournemouth's penalty box to get a shot away but, as has regularly been the case in this contest, the Bournemouth defence crowd him out.

42: Winks tries to unleash a drive from range but his effort is blocked and the ball bobbles to Begovic.


36: Spurs are constantly looking to send the ball down the flanks but Bournemouth are doing well to shepherd Trippier and Vertonghen out. A good first-half showing so far from the visitors.

32: GOOD SAVE! Eriksen curls a ball around the Bournemouth defence for Kane, who scuffs a half-volley on goal which Begovic parries out.
The following corner is headed over the bar by Alderweireld.


29: Kane is caught offside. He's had a very quiet match so far. Bournemouth's back three have done a good job of crowding him out.

26: YELLOW! For S Cook for a rash tackle on Eriksen. Spurs free-kick which the Danish international takes. 
He swings it in to the near post which Alli flicks on, but Bournemouth can clear.

24: Vertonghen whips a ball into the box but it evades everyone. Bournemouth have put in a good defensive performance so far, frustrating the hosts.

22: Alli tries to cushion a header towards the penalty spot for Kane but it's tame and Begovic can make a simple catch.

20: GREAT SAVE! By Lloris! Stanislas' corner hits off Dier and looks set to go in for an own goal. But Lloris was there to get down and make a smart reflex save. Wonderful reactions from the France international.

19:CLOSE AND NO PENALTY! A great counter-attack by Bournemouth as Smith cuts the ball back for Stanislas who has a first-time shot. The ball ricochets off Sanchez and goes out for a corner. 
Stanislas appeals to referee Bobby Madley for a penalty but a corner is awarded.


15: Alli tries a powerful strike from just outside the box but S Cook bravely gets in the way. Spurs are applying the pressure.

13: NEARLY! Eriksen bursts into the box and takes Alli's flick-on in his stride but his first touch uncharacteristically wasn't good enough and Francis hoofs clear.

10: Bournemouth are really struggling to get into this game as Spurs easily stroke the ball around in their half. Feels like we're only minutes away from Spurs scoring the opener.


5: Good defending by L Cook who blocks off Vertonghen and prevents him from getting a cross in.

4: Spurs are setting the tempo here as they look to get off to a fast start. Bournemouth have barely touched the ball yet.

2: Bournemouth look to have set out with a back five while Tottenham are lining up with a back four. Jan Vertonghen is playing at left-back. Tottenham are comfortably passing the ball around right now.


There goes the whistle and Man City head back to the top of the Premier League table.
It was a stunning goal from Kevin de Bruyne that sealed the victory, with Chelsea not offering too much in the way of a response. 
Overall, an entertaining game with highlights on the way!

90+3: Chelsea take it quickly before Courtois can even come up for it, but a Kante foul stops the play and gives City the free kick.
De Bruyne is coming off now and Danilo will play the final few minutes.

90+2: De Bruyne seems to be signalling that he wants to come off with less than a minute left to play. Danilo is stripped and readied. 
Chelsea have a late corner first though. 

90: Yellow card for Otamendi as he clatters into a tackle on Willian, who looks to be in some pain after the challenge. 
Fabregas delivers the free kick and Christensen gets up well to head towards goal, but it just goes over the crossbar. Close for Chelsea.
Three minutes added on.

88: A sweeper 'keeper moment from Ederson there as he comes out of his box to collect a loose ball and does well to hack it away down the field.

85: CHANCE! What a superb strike and superb stop from both sides.
Sterling gets away down the right as he has done so often this evening, and his chipped pass finds Jesus on the left of the box. He does really well to get his effort on target from a tight angle, but Rudiger is there to head away the danger just inches from the line. 

83: There's that change with Gundogan coming on for Sane.

82: City are just trying to stop Chelsea's period of attack by passing the ball between themselves.
They are also preparing another change with Ilkay Gundogan being readied. 


79: So much better from Chelsea now as Azpiliceuta gets away down the right again and is looking to whip a cross into the box, but he can only find Ederson. 
There are huge cries from the home fans as the goalkeeper throws the ball out with some believing he was outside the box. Nothing indicated by the officials though, who have done well this evening.

77: CLOSE! A good period of attack for Chelsea as Pedro bursts into the box, and he's looking for some support as he flicks the ball back into the box but no one is there as City clear. 

76: A fizzing cross into the box from Azpilicueta there as he searches for Batshuayi in the middle, but Otamendi does well to poke it behind. 
A change for City now as the Silva's switch - David coming off for Bernardo.

74: Free kick to Chelsea as Willian gets an elbow in the face from Otamendi. The Chelsea midfielder is back on his feet but keeps touching his face. He'll be fine, I'm sure.
Bernardo Silva being readied.  

72: Here come the final two changes for Chelsea as Pedro and Michy Batshuayi replaces Hazard and Bakayoko.

Oh my! What an absolutely superb strike from De Bruyne and that's what this game needed! 
The Belgian set off the move himself, playing a great give-and-go with Jesus. The striker puts the ball back into the path of De Bruyne and he lets fly from the top of the box, with the ball hammering into the back of the net. 
Courtois had no chance and that is a beauty of a goal.

66: CHANCES! How have City not scored there?! Walker and Silva are the culprits with the former playing a superb ball into the box but Silva's effort hammers off the body of a blue shirt. 
The visitors come again as Walker delivers for a second time, but Jesus just nicks the ball out of Silva's path as it runs through an empty box. 

65: SAVE! A decent collection from Courtois as De Bruyne attempts to find Jesus in the middle of the box. The striker is stretching to get there but he cannot connect before the goalkeeper collects down low.

64: A deep free kick to Chelsea as Azpilicueta gets ahead of Sterling down the left-hand side of the Chelsea box, with the City winger clipping his counter-part to hand the hosts the advantage. 

62: SAVE! A decent effort from Chelsea - the best anyone has had this half anyway - with Fabregas playing it short to Hazard who is alone down the left of the box. 
He takes a few strides before hitting a low, hard shot that is pushed away by Ederson. 

60: Free kick for Chelsea and here comes the first yellow card as Fernandinho tackles Hazard. The City midfielder is convinced he got the ball. He didn't. A correct decision from Martin Atkinson there.

59: There's a delay before the free kick is taken with two balls on the field, but Fabregas eventually obliges but Chelsea decide to keep the ball deep rather than pump it up field. 

58: Free kick to Chelsea as Fernandinho clips the ankles of Willian. Martin Atkinson has a word with the City midfielder but still no yellow cards yet.

57: There's absolutely no let up in the City attack at the moment, as Sterling and Jesus combine to surge down the field, but some more resolute defending from Chelsea sees the ball out wide. 

55: Corner for City as Sane and Silva play a lovely give-and-go as the former makes his way into the box. There's the briefest of clips on the arm by Alonso to make City fans shout for a penalty, but nothing is given as the visitors have a corner. 
The rebounded delivery falls to Sterling at the top of the box who strikes the ball well but his effort flies over the crossbar. 

53: A break in play as Walker and Alonso both go up to win the ball, but end up finding the heads of each other rather than the ball. They should be OK to continue though.

Live Chelsea v Manchester City Price Boosts.

52: NO PENALTY! A shout from City as Jesus clatters into Christensen in the box, but Martin Atkinson instantly waves away the claims. It looked more of a collision than a foul from here.

50: A great start from City here as Sterling tries to flash the ball into the box from the left, but Christensen puts it behind for another corner.
Silva delivers this time, but Jesus' header is directed behind him and Chelsea manage to clear. 

49: Good covering from Rudiger there as Sterling tries to clip the ball into the feet of Jesus but the Chelsea defender is there ahead of the striker to poke it wide. 
De Bruyne delivers the corner but Willian heads it away.

47: Free kick to Man City as Rudiger clips the back of Silva's ankles. De Bruyne plays it back though, and the ball eventually runs wide.

46: Chelsea get the game back underway at Stamford Brdige. 


There's the first half whistle at Stamford Bridge.
Man City have dominated possession but have not been able to find a way through. Both sides have had good chances to take the lead with Alvaro Morata - substituted in the first half - heading over at the start of the game and both goalkeepers called into action. 
Raheem Sterling has been a menace down the right flank but has not been able to carve out a goal for his side just yet. Plenty more to come in the second half!

45: SAVE!! A fantastic reaction save from Courtois as De Bruyne whips in the corner and it is powered towards goal by Fernandinho but the Chelsea goalkeeper leaps to his left to push away the incoming ball.
Two minutes added on.

44: Free kick to City down the right flank as Alonso brings down Sterling. The City players surround the referee - looking for a booking - but nothing is given. 
De Bruyne delivers a great free kick, but Azpilicueta pokes it wide.

41: Not a bad move from City as Sterling dances his way to the top corner of the box before cutting back for the waiting De Bruyne. He in turn dinks the ball into the area, with the ball headed on by Jesus in the middle. 
Sane comes steaming in at the back post, hoping to get a foot onto it but it's not to be as the ball runs behind. 

39: Poor, poor free kick from Willian as it doesn't beat the man at ten yards and goes out for a Chelsea throw-in.

38: Free kick to Chelsea again as Willian is clattered into by De Bruyne. The Brazilian is standing over it.  

37: Free kick to Chelsea as Man City pile into the opposition box, and there are bodies flying everywhere as Martin Atkinson blows his whistle, presumably for a foul.

35: Here comes the switch, Willian the man to replace Morata. 

34: A superb cross from Silva there as he picks out Sterling on the right of the box, and the England man does well to control before hooking the ball back into the box but no one is there to connect.
Meanwhile, Morata looks to be in a bit of bother. He's not been moving well for a few minutes now and Willian is set to come on in his place.

31: Not a bad corner from City as De Bruyne delivers and is met by the head of Otamendi in the middle of the box but he just flashes his effort wide. 


30: Another save, this time from Courtois low down at his post to keep a cross from Silva from probing further into the box.

27: CLOSE!! The best chances since Morata's earl header and they come for Chelsea again. A ball whipped into the box, searching for Morata, is blocked by City before Azpilicueta fires the ball through the box but Ederson is there to make the save. 
City then go on the break through Sterling and he flashes a superb ball across the face of goal but neither Silva or Jesus can apply the touch to tap home. 

24: Free kick to City as Jesus goes to ground after a tussle with Bakayoko.
It's deep and the visitors then win another set-piece as Azpilicueta fouls Deplh. Not the most exciting few minutes, it has to be said.  

22: Play gets back underway as Stones is taken to the touchline for more attention, and City are temporarily down to ten men although it doesn't phase them as they are instantly on the attack.
However, Chelsea manage to block and clear as Stones returns to the field.

20: A snapshot effort from Delph there as Silva's effort is rebounded to the edge of the box, and it's not a bad hit, but Rudiger chucks his body in front of it for a corner. 
Sane delivers and Chelsea do well to clear the initial delivery, but the ball is played back in by De Bruyne and meets the head of Stones at the back post. 
However, up against Rudiger, his header is skewed wide and the Man City defender looks to have landed awkwardly. The medics are on.


Well, that was fun. The Premier League strikes again.

“Yes, it was harsh. I don’t understand – maybe someone can call
me and explain.
“Maybe we can play without fans?”
Note the sarcasm from Pep.



“I just can’t get my head round it. It’s the most incredible
rush. For a referee to send him off, show him a bit of compassion. It’s very
hard to restrain yourself.”

Jamie Redknapp: I thought Bournemouth deserved at least a
point. I thought they were magnificent.
Alan Pardew: Eddie Howe got his tactics spot on. I’m
distraught for him. They deserved more. 

"Madness. It’s absolute madness. We played like we did
against Everton, but missed chances. But when you have big, powerful players
you always have a chance.”

FT: It's all over. And breathe.
A quite extraordinary end. Sterling broke Bournemouth hearts with the final kick of the game, almost immediately after King was denied up the other end. Sterling was then given his marching orders for over celebrating. City go top and Bournemouth remain winless with a very difficult fixture list to come. Stay tuned for reaction. 

90+9: STERLING SENT-OFF FOR A SECOND YELLOW! After the jubilation of his goal, Sterling is given his marching orders for going into the crowd. A pulsating end to the game. Chaos. 

THEY'VE NICKED IT!! WITH THE LAST KICK OF THE GAME!!
A ball in from the right drops to Sterling in the box. His first touch is excellent and he takes a swing. Surman gets back and the ball scuffs off a combination of both of them into the top corner. He jumps into the crowd! City have stolen it.

90+6: GREAT CROSS! Better. Sane plonks a ball to the back post which is headed behind by Daniels.
The corner comes in.. Begovic makes a fine punch clear. 

90+5: Smith goes in late on Sane on the touchline. He goes into the book. We probably have two more minutes left. City not creating anything. 

90+4: Afobe can't continue. He's replaced by Mousset.

90+3: Sterling fouls Arter in midfield and picks up a booking. The play develops and Afobe is now down after bashing into Kompany. 

91: POOR!! A corner is cleared out to Sterling on the edge. Oh my. That's shocking. Lean back more, Raheem. Miles over.

90: Five minutes added on. Guardiola is getting restless in the dugout as he engages in a verbal battle with Howe, who is not happy either. The referee has to come over to have words.

89: Bournemouth deal with another attack. Gosling at the heart of it. He's taken a knock on his ankle. Chance for the hosts to wind down the clock further. 

87: POOR! Aguero tries to whip a low effort around the wall. Begovic watches it go two yards wide. Time running out for City.

86: YELLOW!! Sterling sets sail through the middle and Arter checks his run. Clear foul. 22 yards out. Aguero lining this one up..

84: CHANCE!! Mendy fizzes a ball in from the left. Ake makes a very tired clearance and it drops to Silva about 15 yards out. Daniels slides in and just does enough to put him off. Silva skies his effort way over the crossbar.  

81: SUB!

79: YELLOW! City running out of ideas. King breaks out with the ball and Mendy clips his heels from behind. Three of the CIty back four are in the book now. 

74: POST!! A corner from the left finds Otamendi about eight yards out. He's in acres of space. Bournemouth stop and stare as the City man directs a header that comes back off the post. It drops straight into Begovic's arms. 

72: CHANCE! Aguero gets his first sniff. A break down the right falls to him about 18 yards out. It's a tough one but his finish is straight at Begovic.
SUB! Defoe is replaced by Afobe.

70: City starting to probe away again. Forcing Bournemouth deeper..
SHOT! A long spell of passing breaks to Fernandinho about 20 yards out. Straight at Begovic.

68: SHOT! From the set-piece, the ball breaks to Arter about 25 yards out. Good strike but it deflects over the crossbar.  

67: YELLOW! Defoe nips past Otamendi and wins a foul down the left. One foul too many by the City man. Into the book.

65: SUB! B Silva off. And here comes Aguero. Two up top now for City. 


61: POST!! Big moment. Arter breaks down the left and City are in trouble. His cross finds King about 15 yards out and he cracks a first-time effort which has Ederson beat all ends up. it smacks the woodwork and comes back into play. Unlucky. 

58: City break. De Bruyne powers away down the left. There are three men in the middle waiting but it goes behind all three of them. Smith gets back to complete the clearance. 

57: YELLOW! King moves with the ball into dangerous territory. Kompany sees the danger and flattens the striker with a clever tackle, which was a foul. Clear booking. 

55: City pin Bournemouth back as B Silva gets on the ball. The ball breaks to Sterling on the edge but Cook gets in his face and clears. The City subs - including Aguero - are warming up. 

52: OUCH!! Cook takes man and ball as he thunders into Jesus by the corner flag. He had to get that one right otherwise it would have been borderline red. Jesus dusts himself down and gingerly gets to his feet.

50: WASTE! Sterling has acres of space to run into down the left. He has men in the middle but ends up running the ball out of play. Guardiola has his head in his hands. 

48: Slow start. Ake gets a bit too tight to Jesus and gives away a foul. He has to be careful - he's a on a booking.

45: We are back. City get the game going..

HT: Bournemouth repel one final City attack and get in level. It's a game which will be remembered for a quite breathtaking opening goal from Charlie Daniels. Gabriel Jesus levelled it up and then Nathan Ake could have seen red for being the last man when fouling Jesus. It was all City late on, but the hosts stood firm. See you in 15.

45: Two minutes added on.

43: SAVE!! Fernandinho joins the attack down the right. Jesus plays him in and he fires at the near post. Begovic stands tall to palm clear. It drops back to the midfielder but he produces a classic air-kick. 

41: INJURY! Ake twists his body to clear inside his own box and twists his knee. The medics are on.
He hobbles off. But returns with a hefty limp. He'll try and run this off.

38: Bournemouth need half-time now. City have them camped inside their own half. The two Silva's are probing away.

35: GREAT MOVE! B Silva threads an impeccable ball through to Mendy on the overlap. He gets to the by-line and fizzes a wonderful cross into the six-yard box. There are no takers.

32: CHANCE!! Ake, who has had a nightmare half, hands the ball straight to B Silva. He has D Silva running off him but decides to shoot himself from 18 yards. He curls it straight into Begovic's arms. Really poor finish. 

Here you go Brighton fans.  And for everyone else too, of course!

Coming your way from 5.15pm. It'll make for pretty viewing if you're a Brighton fan.  

FT: A day to remember for Brighton fans! And it will be Pascal Gross' name which goes into the history books. He scored the Seagulls' first-ever Premier League goal - and he went on to score one more and bag an assist too - and it helped them secure a first win since returning to the top flight.

90+3: GOOD SAVE! And it's almost Morrison again! But as he is played over the top, Ryan stands tall and keep out Morrison's effort. Almost over the finish line now.  

90+2: Petering towards the end here. West Brom players trying to find another but that'll be too little too late really. Three minutes left on the clock.

90: And here's the view from my good friend Mr Lagomarsino - sitting in the Amex, which will no doubt erupt at the sound of the final whistle... (He's a West Brom fan mind, so it's one to forget for him. ) 
Five minutes added on.

89: DIVE! Naughty naughty. March is booked for simulation as he goes down under no pressure from Barry, who was close, but not close enough to fool the referee. First yellow of the match!

87: Will Duffy be a happy man to see Morrison's goal go in? He would undoubtedly have been red carded if it didn't cross the line, but as it is he remains on the pitch, hoping to see out the remainder of this match without a hiccup.

84: All West Brom at the moment but Brighton are standing firm. Six minutes plus stoppage time away from a famous win here.

82: The miracle, Part II? Not yet, but the Baggies are in the ascendancy here. Brighton just need to calm things down, but they're looking nervy.
They make a sub too as Hemed makes way for Glenn Murray, 

Well I said they needed a miracle.  and they've got one back here!
It's a looped ball in from Gibbs towards the back post, Burke knocks it down for Morrison who strokes it home.
Duffy tried to take the law into his own hands, quite literally, in his attempts to keep it out, but even though he gets an arm to it, he cannot stop the ball from going in.

76: It's West Brom quite rightly in attack, but Nyom sees his effort blocked and it's hoofed away by Knockaert. 15 minutes for a Baggies miracle. 

74: With Brighton's attack - and Gross in particular - set to grab the headlines, it's worth noting that their defence have looked composed for 99% of this match. A slight switch off from Duffy which allowed Rodriguez to bear down on goal, but apart from that - rock solid. So far.  

71: Final change for West Brom as Livermore, who has done little all afternoon, comes off for James Morrison. Final throw of the dice from Pulis. 

70: Not an ideal return for skipper Evans.  

68: Ironic cheers from the hosts as a rare venture forward from West Brom results in Phillips overcooking a cross.  to put it lightly. Woeful, really. 

66: Pulis will be even more livid with that last goal. Defence all over the place and there was no sign of anyone at right-back when Gross had ages to put in the cross. Again it was Nyom who probably should have been closer.

Two goals for Gross, and now an assist! He's in acres of space down the left and he has time to pick out Hemed, who bravely glances a header in at the near post.

62: Straight swap for Brighton as captain Bruno hobbles off. On comes Liam Rosenior. 

60: SAVE.  JUST! A corner comes in for Brighton and Duffy rises highest at the back-post to head it towards goal. Foster is there to keep it out but again he spills it, and thankfully for West Brom Dawson is there to clear. 

58: SUBS! Indeed it is a double sub for West Brom. Debutant Kieran Gibbs is on for Hegazy, while Rondon is off and on comes Oliver Burke.

56: West Brom get the corner as Nyom tries to get past Knockaert.  It evades everyone and bounces out for a goal-kick.

54: Very sloppy from Dunk as he gives the ball away to Rodriguez, but the Baggies man takes an age to get his shot away and he ends up getting dispossessed. Double sub on the way for West Brom. 

. you score your side's first-ever Premier League goal. And now he has two!

51: Something needs to change here for West Brom. The unbeaten side have been very poor so far and they'll have to produce something special now to even get a point. 

You wait 315 minutes for one.
Hemed holds it up well and then plays it across for Gross, who marches down on goal unopposed and strikes it low from 25 yards out. It's not the strongest of strikes, but it finds the corner and evades Foster.

And we are back underway at the Amex. All to do for the Baggies.


And there's the half-time whistle. What a time to score for the hosts! One for the Brighton history books that, and it's enough to give the Seagulls a slender lead at half-time! 

Finally for Brighton! 315 minutes into life as a Premier League side!
It's a brilliant cross in from March and it finds Gross at the back post. He has time to take a touch, cut inside and tuck it home. It takes a deflection but he won't care.
Pulis will be raging with his defence all over the place, and Nyom didn't read that ball coming in too well at all.

43: Away from kit news, there's a chance for Brighton! It's arguably the best move of the match and it ends with Knockaert finding Gross on the edge of the area, but after turning onto his left foot, his effort flies just over the bar - Foster had it covered. 

So... West Brom's kit.
Made just for the occasion too due to their other shirts clashing with Brighton's home attire. I'm going for pond water green.
Thoughts? Let us know at @SkySportsPL if you fancy.

40: The corner very nearly produces a goal as Hegazy gets a flick onto it, but it just about misses Evans at the back post. 

38: GREAT SAVE! Again the ball falls into Barry's path and his volley is tipped over the bar by Ryan. Corner for the visitors.

35: Just gone a bit quiet again for the hosts. They're enjoying the majority of possession, but a yet to find the breakthrough. 

33: The wait goes on for this man's side - over five hours now without a Premier League goal. 

30: Brighton continue to attack but this move doesn't quite come off as the ball rolls out of Hemed's reach. Promising though, and the Baggies have offered little in response. 

28: BLOCKED! A lively last five minutes or so for Brighton, and particularly Knockaert. It's well worked down the right and it falls back to the winger, who cuts inside but sees his shot blocked. Keep this up and a first PL goal will come in no time.

26: Couple of step-overs from Knockaert and his cross is then headed clear by Evans. It falls to Propper, who hits it from distance, but that deflects and falls kindly for Foster. 

24: This game has finally picked up! A chance down the other end this time for Stephens, but his effort from 25 yards out or so flies high and wide. 

22: OVER! A ball into the box falls for Barry, whose rasping volley deflects over the bar - it actually hits his own player and results in a goal-kick. 

20: SAVE! This time it's better handling from Foster. Knockaert adopts a Sunday league mentality of shoot-on-sight following the goalkeeper's earlier spill, but his effort is collected this time by the Baggies man.

18: So after that mild excitement it's back to normal at the Amex. But even though it was disallowed, can Brighton use that moment as their inspiration to go on and find the net proper? 

15: Krychowiak misses the ball entirely as he brings down Gross and Brighton have the chance to pump one in.
DISALLOWED GOAL! Foster's blushes have been spared here! March unleashes a stinging effort from 25 yards out which the West Brom goalkeeper cannot hold onto - it falls to Duffy to tap the rebound in but the offside flag is correctly raised.
Big let off for the Baggies. 

12: You know what you're getting into when facing Pulis' West Brom - particularly away from home.
There's no real fluidity in Brighton's play so far, and they need to be far more creative if they are to eek out an opening.

9: Ball over the top for Rondon to chase but Dunk does well to glance a header back to Ryan. Chances few and far between early on. 

7: Phillips with a promising run down the right wing for the visitors. He gets beyond Suttner but can't quite get a decent connection on the cross as he scampers to it just before it rolls out. 

5: A very slow start indeed. West Brom not exactly going for it and Brighton not quite capable of creating an opening yet. Interesting to see how this one will pan out.

2: Quiet start at the Amex. Brighton in their usual kit of blue and white stripes, while West Brom are wearing an interesting shade of green which is not too dissimilar to the darker cut of the grass... maybe it's turquoise, or aqua.  I don't really know. Answers on a postcard please.

And away we go on the south coast!

Harry Kane's fortuitous opener is the catalyst for Tottenham as they ease to an impressive 3-0 win against lacklustre Everton at Goodison Park.

One moment you'll definitely want to see is Harry Kane's opening goal for Tottenham - his 100th strike for the club. He swung it in from a wide area on the right and there's definitely been some debate over whether he meant it. The man himself has just spoken to Soccer Saturday though - and has admitted it was a fluke. His strike is coming right up in our highlights package.

So it's been a great day for Tottenham fans and one to forget for Everton supporters - but we expect lots of people on both sides will want to see the match highlights. They're coming up in exactly five minutes from now.

It's all over at Goodison - although in truth that was the case after just a few seconds of the second half. Tottenham turned it on impressively in the first half to go 2-0 up through Kane and Eriksen and when Kane added his second and his team's third of the afternoon, there was no way back for the home side. Kane's finished one century of goals for Spurs and started a new one after a masterclass in forward play, with Davies also catching the eye on the left and Eriksen playing his part. Tottenham finish up as worthy winners.

90: Sigurdsson again tries to create something for Everton but is crowded out and then as he tries to assist Davies the same thing happens, with Tottenham getting plenty of bodies in the way.

90: Sigurdsson takes aim as Rooney frantically tries to get out of his way. He succeeds in that respect, with the shot deflected wide for a corner, but that comes to nothing for the home side.

88: Rooney's really late coming in from behind on Alli and it's a frustrated tackle as much as anything. After taking his former England team-mate's feet away, he is shown a yellow card.

85: Everton come close to pulling one back as Rooney gets on the end of a cross but he heads a foot over the bar. Soon after, Kane comes off as Spurs make their final change of the afternoon, with Son taking his place.

80: If the truth be told, the second half has been a bit of a non-event - with all the hope Everton had with that double change at the break killed almost instantly by Kane's second goal. Few home fans would have any complaints if the final whistle was blown now - although the final change of the day does at least give them a chance to get a look at new signing Nikola Vlasic. He's on for Gueye.

77: Sure enough, the decision is taken to bring Sissoko off - and that means an appearance for Harry Winks off the bench.

76: This doesn't look good for Sissoko, who is receiving treatment after appearing to hurt his ankle. As he is seen to be the Tottenham physio, a number of home fans use the break in play as an opportunity to head for the exits.

71: Eriksen's afternoon is over as he is replaced for the final 19 minutes by Mousa Dembele.

Harry Kane celebrates his second goal of the afternoon after producing a brilliant finish to extend their lead to 3-0 agaisnt Everton at Goodison Park.

67: Rooney tries to release Martina with a cross-field pass and while it's well-intentioned, it's also massively ambitious and the full-back only succeeds in fouling Davies and giving away a free kick. Moments later, Lloris is too slack passing out from defence and gives it straight to Gueye but he shoots just wide.


63: Tottenham are playing with plenty of confidence now, with Alli letting the ball run through his legs then going the long way around Williams. He doesn't quite pull off the move as the ball runs out for a throw but it shows just how much the visitors are enjoying this one this afternoon.

59: Alli hits the deck under a challenge from Williams but there's no chance of the referee giving a penalty and the ball is cleared with nothing given - rightly so.

57: Gueye's name goes into referee Graham Scott's book for a foul on Eriksen. Everton's poor day continues as they struggle to provide the required response.

Tottenham's Christian Eriksen pokes in his team's second goal after Ben Davies' shot was only partially saved by Jordan Pickford.

54: Kane sets up Eriksen for a spectacular volley on the turn but Pickford does enough to keep him out. Kane then has another opportunity soon after as Alli sets him up but the keeper again gets down well to save.

53: Tottenham's third has really knocked the stuffing out of the Goodison crowd, who look shell-shocked as they digest what they've seen so far. There's not much by way of a response from their team just yet - and that will suit the visitors to a tee.

What a start to the second half! Koeman's made a double change in the hope it will help his side but before the new players even have time to settle there's a bigger deficit to reduce. It's another disaster on the flanks for the hosts too with Davies getting space once more to send in a lovely measured cross for Kane, who looks so casual as he produces a brilliant low finish. The game is surely beyond Everton now.

46: We're back underway once again, with Everton getting play going. They've made two changes at the break, with Klaassen and Ramirez coming off for Tom Davies and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Tottenham's Harry Kane (out of shot) crossed from the right to loop in the first goal over Jordan Pickford's head. Did he mean it though? Be sure to tune in to our online match highlights at 5.15pm to judge for yourself!


After a flying start from Everton, they quickly faded and Tottenham have dictated much of the first half so they are good value for their 2-0 half-time lead. There will be much debate over whether Kane meant his goal or not but it clearly impacted on Everton and Eriksen was able to add a second three minutes before the break. It's hard to see a way back for the home side at the moment.

45: It should be three! Kane scampers away down the left and crosses for Alli but he fluffs his chance to sidefoot in and the ball runs away instead. Moments later, Kane shoots low again but pulls just past the post.

Tottenham double their lead and it's a gift from Pickford - who has already been caught out by Kane's opener. Alli crosses from the right and Martina can't clear so Davies shoots low and the former Sunderland keeper can only parry the attempt. In doing so, he pushes it straight into Eriksen's path and he has the easy task of slotting home from just six yards out. Tottenham are in complete control now.

38: Schneiderlin is hustled off the ball by Tottenham and they break clear looking for a second but Sissoko moves too early and the flag is up for offside long before he square to Kane.

37: Tottenham will be delighted to be in front - especially given how these games often pan out. The away side has only won once in the last 17 games between these two teams.

32: Falling behind has roused Everton and they look to drive into the box but Ramirez's ferocious shot is well blocked by Alderweireld. If he hadn't got in the way of that one there's every chance we'd be level again at Goodison.

Tottenham lead - and given it's no longer August, that must mean Harry Kane has put them in front with his 100th competitive goal in Spurs colours. Whether he meant it is another matter.  He picked up on the right flank and appeared to cross but there's real bend on the ball and it loops over Pickford's head and in. If he's meant it, it's brilliant - and if he didn't, it's still pretty good. Spurs deserve to be in front on the balance of play over the last few minutes.

27: . but it comes to nothing. Davies makes the decoy run, Eriksen strikes and fails to clear the wall as it's headed away. Still goalless.

26: Tottenham have a free kick in a promising area - and Eriksen is hovering over it.

25: Dier slips in Eriksen with a lovely disguised pass and it looks for all the world like he's going to put Tottenham in front - only for Martina to read the move brilliantly and make an excellent block. Good defending from the former Southampton man.

24: Sigurdsson and Trippier collide and the Iceland international looks a little delicate afterwards but he seems to be okay. After a lively start, this game has lots its rhythm a touch.


18: Having been on the back foot initially, Tottenham have settled more now and force a corner from Everton as Baines head over Pickford and behind. Eriksen sends the set piece in but it's cleared and he's later penalised for handball on the right flank.

16: Davies hits the left touchline and pulls back for Sissoko but Williams is in the right place to block. Seconds later, Kane makes contact as he is set up but he mistimes his shot and goes wide. That's a let off for Everton.

14: Back come Everton, with Ramirez looking to get into the box and brought down on the left edge by Alderweireld. After the Williams booking, a tone has been set and he follows his fellow defender into the book.

13: Just as I say that, Tottenham make the best chance of the match yet. Alli is given space and time in the box to bring the ball down and he sets up Eriksen, who pulls a shot a yard or so wide of Pickford's right-hand post. He'll feel he should have done better.

12:It's been a pretty open game so far - although it's also a little scrappy in midfield at the moment. The Ramirez chance aside, there hasn't been much else in the way of clear-cut openings.

10: Eric Dier's perhaps lucky - with the Williams yellow in mind - not to go into the book as well as he crunches into Gueye. He gets away with a talking to instead from referee Graham Scott - lucky boy.

7: Martina links well with Rooney and plays low into the mix for Ramirez but Alderweireld is in a good position to distract him just enough that the striker puts his attempt past the post. Good build up from Everton all the same.

6: Everton are playing a high pressing game in these early stages and aren't making it easy for Tottenham as they try to get out of their own half. On one of the occasions they do, however, Harry Kane draws a foul from Ashley Williams and that earns the Wales international the first yellow card of the day.

2: An early ball into the box is aimed at Rooney but it's just a touch too high for him and he can't connect.

1: And we're off, with Tottenham getting the game underway.

Just before we get the action underway, here's a look at both sides one final time. It's hard to decide how this one might go - so stay tuned and find out for yourself!

It's no surprise to see Dele Alli in the Tottenham starting line-up today - but he'll be under more scrutiny than usual after his hand gesture in England's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Monday. He claims it was aimed at Kyle walker but it appeared to be in the direction of the referee - and FIFA have opened disciplinary proceedings.

Captains Leighton Baines and Hugo Lloris stand side by side at the mouth of the tunnel as they prepare to lead their sides out in front of a large crowd at a sunny Goodison Park. Strap yourselves in for this one!


It's all over at St. Mary's and Southampton's goalless streak at home continues. Despite registering 29 goals on goal, two on target, Mauricio Pellegrino's men have now gone six league games without scoring in front of their own fans. 

90+3: CHANCE! Redmond slots Austin through on goal and the striker takes the ball in his stride before lashing the ball into the side-netting.

90+2: CLOSE! Yoshida pulls rank at the set piece and drifts a superb effort a yard wide.

90: Into THREE minutes of added time at St Mary's as Ayew barges into the back of Romeu and gives away a free-kick in a great position for the hosts.

87: Cedric carries the ball unopposed into the Swansea half and gets carried away, unleashing a long-range shot which never looked like hitting the target.

85: SUB! Third and final change for Swansea as McBurnie replaces Routledge.

85: NO PENALTY! Austin's volley strikes Bartley's arm at close range but the referee ignore Southampton second penalty appeal.

83: CHANCE! Another opportunity goes begging for Saints as Tadic curls an effort inches over the bar from the edge of the area. He really should've found the target there.
81: SUB! Bartley replaces Abraham for Swansea.

80: WHAT A CHANCE! Not for the first time, Southampton should be ahead - they should be home and hosed! Romeu flicks a cross on in the area to Yoshida at the back post but, with the goal gaping, the centre-back somehow heads over. 

79: SAVE! That's more like it! Tadic lets fire from 25 yards and his swerving effort draws a fine save from Fabianski.

77: Bertrand and Boufal combine nicely inside the Swansea area but Naughton gets a crucial nick on the ball to deflect it behind for another corner, which again fails to lead to a chance. 

76: Cedric over-hits a cross into the Swansea area but it's not unsuccessful as Naughton panics and heads behind for a corner, which comes to nothing. 


74: SUB! Swansea's first change sees Fulton replace Britton.

73: Boufal whips a fine free-kick into the Swans area but, with Saints players queuing up at the back post to convert, Fabianski races off his line to gather.

71: SUB! Second change for Southampton as Ward-Prowse makes way for Boufal.

69: SUB! Southampton's first change sees Austin replace Gabbiadini.

68: Bertrand keeps the ball alive at the byline, cutting it back for Gabbiadini, who swivels and fires a low ball across the six-yard box. Unfortunately, no one has made the run and the ball goes behind for a goal kick.


63: Gabbiadini receives the ball down the right flank, cuts inside onto his left foot and fires a cross into the area which Cedric narrowly misses.

61: Tadic floats a delightful ball into the Swansea area which Redmond gets on the end of, but his header is blocked by Naughton before it can test Fabianski.

58: Redmond cuts inside his marker on the left and bursts into midfield but wastes all of his good work by firing a pass into Cedric, who gives away a free-kick trying to retrieve it.

56: Neat build-up again from Southampton as they work the ball down the left channel, but Bertrand's first-time cross is blocked by the covering Naughton.

54: Routledge receives a throw-in on his chest in the Southampton area but his hooked cross is plucked out of the air by Forster.

52: CLOSE! Saints are very neat and precise building up attacks but their finishing continues to let them down, as Gabbiadini curls a left-footed effort wide.

49: Saints respond by winning two corners in quick succession but they're unable to create a clear opening, with the final cross into the area gathered by Fabianski. 

47: CHANCE! Abraham has been a real live wire this afternoon and he's just gone so close to breaking the deadlock, turning on a sixpence in the area before seeing Cedric block his goal-bound effort.

KICK-OFF! Southampton get the second half underway!


A first half of frustration for Southampton as they fail to find the breakthrough. Chances galore for the Saints but their inability to put the ball in the back of the net at home continues to be an issue. 

44: Romeu loses possession in midfield as Abraham is played through on goal, but the Swansea striker's 20-yard shot is blocked by Yoshida. 

43: Olsson drifts a cross into the Southampton area but Abraham is unable to stretch high enough to get on the end of it.

41: OUCH! Olsson and Ward-Prowse chase a ball all the way to the byline, where the Swansea full-back is nudged over the adverting hoardings. That's got to hurt!

37: CHANCE! Swansea clear the Southampton's fifth corner of game but the ball is returned immediately and finds Yoshida, whose acrobatic volley flashes wide.

35: CHANCE! Lovely play from Saints down the left as Gabbiadini and Tadic combine before a cross into the area looks set to find Ward-Prowse, but the midfielder's timing is all wrong and the ball sails over him. 

33: YELLOW! Romeu picks up the second booking of the game for clattering into Carroll with an aggressive barge after winning a header. The Spaniard got the ball and plenty of the man.

30: Redmond delivers another decent corner into the Swansea area but the visitors have heeded their previous warnings and cover the near-post area.

On Soccer Saturday, Phil Thompson reckons Southampton should have had a penalty there.
"Fernandez gets it all wrong. He's nowhere near Tadic, who does tend to go down, but for me it was a penalty."

27: NO PENALTY! Tadic beats Fernandez to the ball in the area, goes to ground and appeals for a penalty, but referee Jones waves play. The official was in a great position to make a decision, I don't know how he's missed that one. 

25: SAVE! Saints pushing for the opener here as Ward-Prowse picks up the ball on the edge of the area, but Fabianksi is more than a match to his curling effort.


24: Redmond is allowed to carry the ball into the Swansea half with relative ease before firing a rasping drive over from 25 yards.

21: Saints applying the pressure here as Redmond delivers into the Swans area, but Ward-Prowse can't rise high enough to head it goalwards. The ball finds its way back to Redmond on the left, and he then drags a shot wide at the near post. 

20: CLOSE! More joy for Southampton down the left as Tadic plays Redmond in behind the Swans defence. The ball is then cut back to Ward-Prowse on the penalty spot and his shot is blocked by Mawson and Olsson before going out for a corner.

18: CHANCE! Bertrand plays a one-two with Tadic before whipping a stunning ball into the area, but there's so much pace on the cross that Gabbiadini can only turn it over the bar. 

16: YELLOW! Redmond picks up the first booking of the game for tripping Fabianski as he kicks from hand.

15: Southampton win a free-kick 35 yards from goal which Ward-Prowse whips into the area, but his delivery is uncharacteristically poor and doesn't beat the first man. 

It's been a lively old start at St Mary's.  we could have seen three goals already!

10: HUGE CHANCE! Tammy Abraham has a glorious chance to score on his Premier League debut for Swansea but, having got on the end of Routledge's inch-perfect cross, he heads agonisingly wide of the target. Both teams should be on the scoresheet here!


It's probably not going to go down as a classic but there were two great goals and plenty of talking points at the King Power Stadium on Monday Night Football.
Until next time.


Here's our report from the King Power Stadium as Leicester battled back to hold West Brom to a draw.
Read it here

"It’s happened to us a few times this year, where we’ve been
leading and let it slip. But as I’ve said before it’s a tough league, every
team that you play, if you take the top six out, there’s not a lot between
them.
"The Leicester bench shows how good this club is, and for us
to come and work as hard as we did, I was a bit disappointed at times because
they’ve got to use the ball with a bit more quality."

"We Finished on the front foot after changing shape. We got a response and gave it everything. Bit laboured first half."
"We worked in training on breaking them down in that setting, but a game is different. We were resilient to fight back." 
"Riyad probably had an easier chance just before, which he would expect to score. But he kept his head up and got his reward."





"We won't get any points for it being a classic. We didn't make the most of our possession in the final third." 
On Chadli's goal he reflected, "I was struggling to see it from the start. I had to stand my ground and hope he goes my side."


"I finished the game in a quarter of a piece.. We're delighted with a point  we're gutted we couldn't hold on but they're a top team." 
On his collision with Jamie Vardy he said, "I had to do what I had to do."


FULL-TIME! The full-time whistle blows and a few boos are heard around the King Power. A point isn't really good enough for Leicester given their league position but they will be happy it wasn't nothing given the position they found themselves in with ten minutes to go.

90+4: SUB! Leicester with a final change as Vicente Iborra makes way for Andy King. 

90+1: Five minutes of added time. Can either side find a winner?

90: Leicester doing more to win this game as we approach the end at the King Power. Slimani's physicality up front has made a big difference since coming on, most obviously with the assist for Mahrez but also by providing a focal point against West Brom's deep defence. 

87: Hegazi's not had a great game tonight but he's just made a potentially vital intervention there, just getting his head to the ball to nudge it away from Slimani, who was lurking just behind him ready to pounce. 

84: SUBS! Couple of changes for West Brom as Gareth McAuley replaces Nacer Chadli and James McClean comes on for Jay Rodriguez. 

83: Frankly bizarre that Myhill is still on the pitch for West Brom. He's not even fit enough to clear the ball properly as he pokes a backpass out of play for a throw instead.
He's then called into action to deny Maguire from range, but it's a simple enough stop.

Curse of the commentator. West Brom had been defending well but Chillwell swings a ball into the box and it is only half cleared as far as Mahrez who takes it beautifully on his chest and finishes well across the keeper into the bottom corner with his weaker right foot.

79: It's starting to look like it might not happen for Leicester tonight. Still plenty of probing and pushing but West Brom seem comfortable right now. 

"Chillwell will be a left wing-back here for Leicester. He'll offer more width and try and get some crosses into Slimani."

74: SUBS! Double change for Leicester as Ben Chilwell and Islam Slimani come on for Danny Simpson and Kelechi Iheanacho.



70: Mahrez twisting and turning to try and find some space on the edge of the area, but there's no way through the West Brom wall right now. 20 minutes to go. 

68: YELLOW! A poor Schmeichel throw puts Albrighton under pressure and he's forced to bring down Dawson and pick up a booking. 

66: Real blow to Leicester that, especially considering West Brom have barely threatened all night. Does Shakespeare start to come under pressure if they lose this? 

"I’m not quite sure as to Kasper’s view of this – he didn’t
move! He thought it was going the other way, you see him stepping to his right
and then it’s far too late to get back.
"From Chadli there’s nothing wrong with the technique and
finish there. Albion have been pushing in the last five and they get their
reward." 

The resulting free-kick is taken by Nacer Chadli and hit straight with wicked dip into the back of the Leicester net. It first appeared to take a deflection but on second viewing it's a brilliant strike.

62: YELLOW!: Leicester have a chance to break but a hefty touch from Iheanacho allows Dawson to nick it away and the follow through sees the Nigerian booked.

60: Just over half an hour to go now and West Brom have now settled a little bit. You wonder which manager will make the first change and whether they'll both eventually just take the point. 
Myhill still doesn't look at all comfortable in goal for the Baggies, but Pulis doesn't want to appear to risk putting on young Palmer. 

56: The level of sound has gone up a notch at the King Power after those two big Leicester chances. They'll want to take advantage of their momentum while they can as West Brom look a bit rattled. Dawson nearly just played a pass right into Vardy on the edge of the area, but luckily for the defender it nutmegged him. 

53: West Brom have already turned to their back up goalkeeper and it appears their problems between the sticks are worsening as Myhill goes down following a hefty collision. He seems alright though and the game continues. 

"Oh my word, on his left foot as well! Sums up his season so
far. He would have buried this one in his sleep in their title-winning season.
Great play between Vardy and Albrighton, and what a howler from Mahrez. No
physical contact on him – nothing to put him off."


51: BIG CHANCE! This has to be the opener for Leicester. Vardy releases Albrighton with a clever backheel, and he charges in and plays the ball into Mahrez in the box. It falls for him perfectly on his left foot, but somehow he conspires to leather it over the bar. 
What a miss. 

48: CHANCE! Very close to  an opener for Leicester as Maguire nudges a header towards goal at the far post, but Dawson gets a foot in to steer it off the line and away. 

"I think the linesman, what is he 10 yards away, should be
helping the referee with this decision.
"Right on the line as well, but just outside I think you could
argue. I think the yellow is fair enough."

47: YELLOW! Bit of a let off for West Brom. Hegazi's backpass is short and allows Vardy to nip in and knock it past the Baggies' keeper right on the edge of the box. He ends up getting clattered and Myhill picks up a booking for his trouble. 

SECOND HALF! We're back underway at the King Power Stadium!

We hope so.


HALF-TIME! A relatively uneventful first half is brought to an end. Both sides had openings with Chadli firing wide and Myhill making a fine save to deny Simpson but neither manager will be completely satisfied with their side's performance thus far.

45: Leicester ending the half with a bit of a flourish. Mahrez finds Albrighton and he puts a peach of a low ball across the face of goal, but no one is there to turn it home. That should be bread and butter for a striker like Iheanacho. 
One minute added on.

43: A deep cross from the right finds Fuchs at the back post whose volley bounces up of the ground and nearly arrives perfectly on the head of the waiting Vardy. The Englishman is muscled out of it but it gives Leicester a corner.

40: OVER! A long way over as Krychowiak looks up 25 yards from goal and has an absolutely awful pop.

37: Strong defending from Maguire shuts out Jay Rodriguez as he looks to latch on to a Chadli through ball.

"It’s through a number of players as well so I don’t know
how late he’s seen this one, but it’s a top save from Myhill.
"Simpson caught it as sweet as you like – yes it was fairly
close but Myhill has done ever so well."


All over at the Emirates, Arsenal have run out comfortable winners over Bournemouth.
A good response from the Gunners to their heavy defeat at Liverpool, while the Cherries are still looking for their first points of the Premier League season.

90+2: SAVE! Sanchez steps inside after playing a one-two with Ozil and draws a decent low stop from Begovic. Little question over Sanchez's commitment, he's been very bright since coming on.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

88: SAVE! Cech is called into action, tipping King's header over the bar after an excellent chipped cross by Ibe from the right. The resulting corner is cleared.

86: Sanchez has been predictably lively since coming onto the pitch and he tries to add Arsenal's fourth, driving into the box and firing on goal, but Ake blocks his effort.

83: Sanchez looks for Giroud again but a backpedalling Francis just about does enough to help the ball back to his goalkeeper. We are drifting towards a conclusion at the Emirates.

79: Coquelin could be in trouble. He stretches for the ball and immediately pulls up with what looks like a muscular injury. 
Arsenal have used all their substitutes - Coquelin was introduced himself - and the hosts will have to play the final stages with 10 men.

77: CHANCE! The two substitutes combine - Sanchez sliding a pass into Giroud - and the Frenchman tests Begovic with a stinging drive from a narrow angle.
It would not be a surprise if Arsenal added a couple more goals before full-time.

73: SUBS! Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud are on, replacing Lacazette and Welbeck.
The Chilean - who was close to joining Man City on Deadline Day - gets a decent reception from the Emirates crowd.

71: CHANCE! More sloppy play in midfield by Bournemouth as Xhaka steals possession and releases Ozil, who looks back for Coquelin.
The Frenchman tries to guide the ball into the corner but his effort from the edge of the box takes a deflection for a corner, which the visitors clear.


70: SUB! Bournemouth make their final change as Defoe is replaced by Mousset.

69: Ibe is then tripped by Ozil and Bournemouth have a free-kick in a decent position.
Ibe takes but never gets enough curl on it - miles wide.

68: Arsenal have just eased off over the last 10 minutes and Bournemouth are having more of the play. 
Daniels gets away down the left and his cut-back almost breaks for Ibe but Arsenal scramble clear.

65: SUB! First change for Arsenal as Aaron Ramsey is replaced by Francis Coquelin.

63: Bournemouth have just enjoyed a spell of possession in the Arsenal half but little in the way of chances for the visitors so far - apart from that one for Defoe.

59: CHANCE! Welbeck is on fire! He skips away from three Bournemouth defenders and tries an audacious chip from a tight angle. It's a great effort too, leaving Begovic stranded, but it drops just wide of the post. 

57: CHANCE! Ozil spots the run of Ramsey and finds the Welshman in the Bournemouth area but Begovic is well placed to save his snap-shot.

55: Welbeck is on the hunt for a hat-trick and tries to latch onto Ramsey's through ball. Francis reads this one well, though, clearing up for Bournemouth.

53: So Bournemouth have already made two changes, they are three goals down and Arsenal look in the mood for more. This could get ugly.

That could be it! Bournemouth fail to take their chance at one end and Welbeck punishes them with his second goal of the game at the other.
Gosling gives the ball away cheaply inside his own half and Ramsey slips a pass into Welbeck.
He still has plenty to do but guides a fine low finish into the opposite corner.

50: POST! Defoe hits the woodwork! Ibe delivers an excellent cross as Defoe drifts into space between two Arsenal defenders. He flicks his header on goal, it hits the post and comes out, with Defoe unable to turn home the rebound.

50: Bournemouth have come out for the second half with a little more energy. They're on the front foot, pressing Arsenal in their half.

46: A half-time change for Bournemouth as Simon Francis comes on for Tyrone Mings.
And we're back under way.



About as one-sided a first half as you are likely to see. Very impressive by Arsenal, who lead thanks to goals by Danny Welbeck and Alexandre Lacazette. Plenty to ponder for Eddie Howe.

45: The heavens have opened at the Emirates, where we will have THREE minutes of added time.

41: CHANCE! Brilliant by Arsenal! They sweep forward and find Bellerin down the right, he clips up a cross to the far post and Kolasinac smashes a shot that deflects off Smith for a corner.
Arsenal want handball - and a penalty - but referee Anthony Taylor is not interested. It certainly struck the arm but Smith was so close to the original effort.

40: SUB! Fraser has not recovered from that early knock and Ibe is on in his place.

38: CHANCE! A mistake by Begovic nearly gifts a chance to Lacazette. Welbeck closes down the goalkeeper after a pass back to Begovic by Mings, the deflected clearance falls to Lacazette but Begovic recovers well to smother.
The ball actually burst in the contact so there's a little delay as we wait for a new one. Begovic is not happy with Mings for that backpass, it put him under pressure after Welbeck read it well.

37: It looks like an early change for Bournemouth, Jordon Ibe is getting ready to come on.

35: So far so good for Arsenal, it's been a decent response to that horror show at Liverpool.

32: Bournemouth have not really got going at all today. Arsenal are passing through them at will and look a threat to score every time they come forward.

Far too easy for Arsenal!
Ozil plays a great forward pass into Lacazette, Ake gambles on the interception and completely misses the ball, allowing Welbeck and the Frenchman to link up.
Cook can't get close enough to Lacazette, who then fires past Begovic from the edge of the box. A clinical finish.

27: Arsenal force a couple of corners in quick succession, the second of which is swung in towards Koscielny. He gets above his marker at the back post but Bournemouth react quickest and clear their lines.

25: Fraser is fine to continue for the visitors.

23: Daniels makes a good run inside Bellerin and Ake looks for the pass. Mustafi on the cover makes a mess of his clearance but it runs through to Cech anyway.
A couple of Arsenal errors there in defence but they get away with it.
Fraser has just taken a knock for Bournemouth after a challenge by Bellerin and he needs treatment.

21: Here's a look at Welbeck's opener for Arsenal.


18: CHANCE! Xhaka releases Ozil with a lovely through ball. The German checks back, finds Lacazette, who tees up the onrushing Xhaka but the midfielder curls his first-time effort well over the bar.
It's all Arsenal at the moment. Bournemouth are struggling to keep up.

16: SAVE! Begovic is at full stretch to keep out Ozil's free-kick. A fantastic stop from the Bournemouth goalkeeper.

15: Superb play by Arsenal as they run rings around the Bournemouth defence. Lacazette, Ramsey and Welbeck are all involved, with first-touch passing throughout, before referee Anthony Taylor pulls play back for a foul on Welbeck on the edge of the area.
Ozil looks likely to take.

13: SAVE! Kolasinac strides forward again but slightly overruns it this time, the ball breaking to Xhaka 30 yards from goal. He takes the shot on first time and Begovic parries it wide for a corner, which is cleared at the second attempt.

10: That should just settle a few nerves for Arsenal in front of their home crowd. It really was very good play by Kolasinac, who burst forward to create the goal after a one-two with Ramsey.

The perfect start for Arsenal!
Kolasinac looks a real handful down the left and it's his cross that tees up the chance for Welbeck.
The forward doesn't make the cleanest contact with his header - it actually comes off his shoulder - but the effort wrong-foots Begovic and Arsenal lead.

5: Better by Arsenal as Bellerin plays a give and go with Ozil and Daniels just about scrambles back to clear for a corner. Good defending.
Ozil takes the resulting set-piece but Ake rises well to head away from danger.

4: Monreal climbs over the back of King, giving Bournemouth a free-kick in the Arsenal half. They take it quickly and work the play down to Smith on the right but they take too long to deliver and Welbeck harries back to win a throw for the home team.

3: Both teams have opened up by playing three at the back - the formation is very much in vogue after Chelsea's success last season.
Arsenal are controlling the ball in the early stages but all the action is in the middle third.


FT: It's all over, Liverpool's frustrating week continues. They had the chances but could not break down Burnley, who battled hard for a well-deserved point.

90+3: Can fires over before going into the referee's notebook for a coming together with Cork. Cork is also booked for his part in the incident.

90+2: Pope tips Can's speculative effort behind for a corner, which is wasted. More frustration for the home side!

90: There will be FOUR added minutes.

90: SAVE! Liverpool come forward again through Salah. The Egyptian cuts inside onto his right foot before curling a shot straight at Pope, who makes a comfortable save.

87: SUBS! Burnley bring on Westwood and Vokes to replace Defour and Wood.

86: SAVE! Alexander-Arnold's cross is met by Solanke six yards out but the ball crashes off the crossbar and out. Pope looked like he got a crucial touch there. 
Was there a penalty in the build-up? Salah went to ground under a challenge from Mee, but referee Roger East was unmoved. 

84: SAVE! Milner's cross picks out Alexander-Arnold at the far post and the full-back powers a volley goalwards. Pope does brilliantly to get across and keep it out right on the goal line.

82: CHANCE! Mee gets in again at the far post and this time he's denied by Mignolet.

81: CORNER! Mignolet thinks about coming for the ball but decides against it. Mee is free at the far post and heads the ball goalwards. Matip is on the line to head behind for another Burnley corner.

79: SUBS! Coutinho's afternoon is over, as is Firmino's. They are replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain and Solanke.

78: Coutinho sets his sights on goal, but once again fires over the target.

76: The frustration continues to build at Anfield as Burnley counter again. Brady cuts inside onto his left foot and gets a shot away which is easily caught by Mignolet.

73: Burnely counter as Arfield looks to thread the ball through for Wood, but Klavan makes a crucial interception just in the nick of time.

72: Milner stands a cross up to the far post and Can rises highest to meet it, but heads the ball over the crossbar.

70: Coutinho tip toes his way past Lowton and looks set to get a shot away until Tarkowski comes across to make a brilliant last-ditch tackle.

68: FREE-KICK! Tarkowski is convinced Brady's free-kick takes a flick off a Liverpool player and he leaves it to go out for what he thinks is a Burnley corner. However, the referee points for a goal kick much to the bemusement of the defender.

65: Ward heads Coutinho's diagonal pass back towards Pope and for a split second it looks like Salah might nick the ball. However, he doesn't get enough of a touch on the ball to take it away from Pope.

64: BLOCK! Frimino and Sturridge combine before the latter lifts the ball over the top for Milner. The midfielder volleys the ball goalwards but his effort is brilliantly blocked by Tarkowski.

61: WIDE! Robertson charges forward. He has Salah in the middle but ignores his team-mate, dragging a shot wide of the far post.

59: SAVE! Sturridge powers the ball goalwards and Pope turns the ball away from goal.

58: WIDE! Robertson pulls the ball back for Coutinho, whose shot deflects wide of the target.

56: YELLOW! Pope goes into the book for time wasting, much to the delight of the home fans.

55: CROSS! Milner swings a high cross into the box. Pope thinks about coming but he eventually leaves it, and it's the right call as the ball sails out at the far post for a goal kick.

54: SAVE! Can drives the ball goalwards from 20 yards. It's a fizzing strike but Pope does well to beat the ball to safety.

51: SHOT! It's all Liverpool at the moment as Coutinho drives the ball over the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area. He's getting closer.

49: Coutinho twists and turns past three challenges before powering the ball high over the crossbar from 25 yards.

47: Sturridge drives at the heart of the Burnley defence before attempting to catch Pope out with a dink, but he's put too much on it as the ball sails over the crossbar.

46: Burnley get us back underway.

Liverpool are 4/11 favourites to go on to win with Burnley
out to 12/1 despite taking the lead, while the draw is priced at 10/3. The Reds also feature in the Soccer Saturday Price Boost, which is 100/30 in-play - that's a treble on Liverpool, Man City (leading 3-0) and Leeds (0-0).

HT: Firmino skips past Defour before seeing his shot blocked by Tarkowski and that's the last action of the first-half. It's been all Liverpool in terms of possession but the scores are locked at 1-1 after Salah's strike cancelled out Arfield's opener. Plenty for both sides to think about at the break at Anfield.

45+2: SAVE! Alexander-Arnold makes a run on his outside, but Sturridge ignores him, cutting in on his left foot before seeing his shot saved by Pope.

45: There will be THREE minutes of added time.

45: FREE-KICK! Brady's cross picks out Mee, who heads wide from around 12 yards.

44: SAVE! Salah wraps his foot around the ball and hits the target, but Pope gets down to make a comfortable save.

PIC: Salah pulled Liverpool level just three minutes after they fell behind.

42: WIDE! Cheers ring around Anfield as the net bulges but the ball nestles into the side netting. Coutinho's slide pass releases Sturridge, who fires a shot into the side netting. 

39: FREE-KICK! Brady's cross is punched clear by Mignolet. The goalkeeper commanded his penalty area well there.

37: SAVE! Burnley are under the pump here. They have nine men back in their own penalty area as Salah's weak shot is saved by Pope.

35: CHANCE! Milner fires the ball across goal and everybody misses it as it runs away to safety on the far side.

34: CORNER! Can and Matip hover at the far post but Cork gets up to head Salah's cross clear.

33: Firmino clips the ball forward in search of Sturridge but between Tarkowski and Ward, Burnley clear the ball behind for a corner.

Liverpool respond immediately. Can's pass picks out Salah, who brings the ball down in the penalty area before smashing it past Pope and into the back of the net.

29: CORNER! Liverpool look to strike back immediately but Pope comes of his line confidently to claim the catch.

From out of nowhere Burnley lead! Liverpool don't deal with Brady's flick on and the ball bounces kindly for Arfield on the edge of the penalty area, who strikes the ball beyond Mignolet and into the bottom corner.

24: Coutinho's shot is blocked  but the ball rebounds to Matip, who almost picks out Salah with a ball over the top. The winger cannot bring the ball under his control but it doesn't matter as the flag is up for offside.


22: CHANCE! More Liverpool pressure as Sturridge's cross picks out Salah at the far post. However, the Egypt international cannot direct his header on target.

20: BLOCK! Salah slips the ball through for Sturridge, who cuts back onto his left foot. He gets a shot away but Ward slides in to make a brilliant block.

18: PENALTY? Salah looks to turn in the penalty area and goes to ground under a challenge from Tarkowski. The Kop wants a penalty but referee East allows play to go on.

Right, that is all for today. Thanks for your company. Plenty more reaction coming up on the Sky Sports website and be sure to join us again next Saturday for Manchester United v Tottenham.
Until then, goodbye.

It's been quite a year for Kane.

A subdued Jurgen Klopp - who can blame him after that result - exits stage left as our coverage of today's post-match press conferences concludes.

“We don’t have to talk about top four today. We are where
we are, we deserve that. If Tottenham needed to be geniuses to come through us
then there is no debate. But when you make the mistakes we did we have to work
on that, it was too easy for Tottenham, much too easy.”

“I really don’t want to blame players. Dejan was no worse
than anyone else. We had to change something, make things more stable. I have not spoken to him yet. I could’ve taken another
one off and it wouldn’t have made a difference, we still conceded two goals."

“You cannot get results with a performance like today against
Tottenham. I don’t want to say anything positive about us. Whatever you say
today about us in a negative is right, we were wrong.”

"The first goal is unbelievably easy to defend. We only
had to clear the ball. The second goal we missed the moment to counter press,
Dejan missed a header and Son, who was in a better possession had an easy goal.
Third goal was another present. We lost the ball, gave away a free-kick. It’s a
free-kick in the middle of nowhere, there was nobody for the second ball and
they scored." 

"It’s our responsibility. Today you say two teams with a  lot of potential. I’m not saying this because we
were good, we weren’t. In the crucial moments we were not there. We defended
poorly in all parts."

Hear from a very happy Tottenham boss.

Here's what Mauricio Pochettino had to say about Kane after he held his hamstring as he was substituted late in the game.
"He's tired, three games in one week and the effort was amazing from him. Harry Kane is a fantastic player, one of the best strikers, it's difficult to find words to describe him, he's unbelievable, so professional, the effort when we don't have the ball, everything is fantastic."

Kane is onto 86 Premier League goals after today, closing in on the record.

“Yes I saw him before. It was so emotional. It is
difficult to let him go because when you are in front of him you want to share
a moment with him. To meet him again is fantastic. He is the best player ever
in football. He is massive. He remembers every moment we played at Newells Old
Boys. That’s what makes him special. Harry Kane and Hugo Lloris were introduced
to him. I don’t know what he makes of Spurs, you should ask him.”

Hear from Jurgen Klopp as he reflects on Liverpool's "bad, bad, bad" defending.

“It’s so important the performance will bring us more confidence.
It is true we are in the beginning of the season and anything can happen, but
after a good result and performance in Madrid, to follow that with a display against
one of the best teams in the Premier League was good.”

Redknapp: “That Tottenham back three is exceptional. The players they
didn’t have today it had no effect whatsoever. Tottenham and Man City are going
to go head-to-head for the title.
Souness: “Don’t write Manchester United out of it as they’ll cause problems but
if you are asking anyone who is interesting them in football right now it's Tottenham and
Man City”
Henry: “This is the first time they’ve won a really big game here because
today was a man’s performance. They were just superb and were missing it
before.”

"It’s another fantastic performance from Harry. He is amazing,
one of the best strikers in the world. But I am happy with everyone, from Hugo
to Harry, everyone gave their best and the performance was good. The team performance
was very good.”

“I am so happy. The effort was fantastic. For my players
to be ready again after Madrid is pleasing. It was very good and I am so
pleased for the team and our fans because we changed that feeling that it was
difficult to play at Wembley. It’s starting to feel like this is our home. It’s
important to get that feeling.”

Hear from Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son as they reflect on the match.

“These are mistakes Liverpool make time and time again when you
watch them defensively, but Kane is just playing a game different to most centre
forwards. He has so much appreciation and understanding of where he is.
“I know Thierry was of that level and it’s a joy to watch Kane.
His movement, he’s so economical. He’s so thoughtful, he understands the game.”

Graeme Souness says he thinks this is as low as he has seen Jurgen Klopp. The Liverpool boss is certainly quite critical in his assessment of his side.
"These situations where games are decided need to be completely different. I could explain a lot of things in 20 minutes or 20 hours but it doesn't make it better.
"Now we have to realise that we are responsible for this and nobody else. Of course we can fix it and we have to fix it as well." 

“It’s the way they won. It unlike
Tottenham in terms of possession but like Dortmund. I will mention two guys that had a different type
of game: Eriksen and Alli.
“Alongside Winks, they defended in a 5-3-2. It’s hard to
play from right to left with that.
“They showed a different side. It was almost like Chelsea
did to them, the 5-3-2. You sometimes need to change your way of playing and
they did it when they have it. 30+ per cent possession and they were brilliant
with it.”

"Bad, bad, bad" is how Jurgen Klopp describes Liverpool's defending. 
"The whole game the whole result was all our fault - Tottenham were good, they needed to be good, but we made it much too easy for them.
"The first goal was a throw-in and we are not really there. It was just really bad, bad, bad defending. The second, a counter attack, when the ball passes Dejan Lovren it is already too late. Coming back in the game with the goal we had our chances, but it's nothing to talk about today.
"We came here for a result and had not one second to get a result."


"Take nothing away from Tottenham. It defies logic about possession winning games. Kane is so direct, so dangerous. There
were so many good players for Tottenham today. The
first two goals Liverpool concede are so unprofessional."

Tottenham close the gap on Manchester United while Liverpool are down to ninth - 12 points behind Manchester City.

Harry Kane: "We wanted to start fast and get the crowd on their feet and
that’s what we did. Getting the one right before half-time really helped us and
we played really well in the second half. Very happy with the performance."

What a platform this week could be for Spurs with some really big games coming up. In the next six they face Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund. You can watch their clashes with United and Arsenal both live on Sky Sports as well.

Unless you're a supporter of either of the Merseyside clubs.

And that is that. A dominant victory for Spurs. Another question-raising defeat for Liverpool. As good as Spurs were, it was Liverpool's defending which really cost them any chance of a positive result.
Stay tuned for highlights and also analysis and reaction from the managers and Souness, Neville and Henry.

“I’m surprised [by today’s game]. I expected a good Liverpool
performance, it’s a big moment in the season and I thought this game would suit
them with Tottenham playing the way they do. But the mistakes have been absolutely devastating
for them. Unnecessary and unforced.”

90: Just two minutes to be added on.

90: Plenty of empty seats in the away end now as full-time approaches. Expect there will be a tough, and potentially critical, assessment of Liverpool from Graeme Souness after the game finishes.

88: A worry for Spurs as Kane goes down and play is stopped..
He's quickly back to his feet but he does hold his hamstring for a few seconds as he is subbed. Another key contribution from the striker, who is replaced by Llorente.

86: Salah bends in a free-kick but it's headed away. Same again from a corner that fails to beat the first man.

84: Liverpool make their final change as Can, who was booked earlier in the game, is replaced by Grujic.

82: Salah's performance has certainly been a bright spot for Liverpool. He has looked really threatening whenever he has got the ball and has caused Aurier plenty of problems. Could have had a couple more goals too if his finishing was sharper.

80: Liverpool are applying some pressure, and Spurs respond by making a change as Dier comes on for Eriksen.

78: Lovely turn from Oxlade-Chamberlain on the edge of the box to get himself a yard, but his shot is well blocked.
SAVE! Aurier is then robbed and the ball is cut into the middle where Salah shoots first time.. straight at Lloris though and it's well saved.

“Going forward, when you add Lallana and Mane to the equation
they’d be as good as anybody. If I was playing in this team it would drive me
mad how many individual mistakes this back four makes.
“These are individual mistakes time and time again. This is
why the manager wanted to buy a centre back in the summer. 
"They are going to
keep making these mistakes week in, week out. It must drive the likes of
Philippe Coutinho crazy because they have to score three or four goals to win a
game.”

76: Eriksen is now playing in a more advanced position after Son's substitution. And here's a change for Liverpool as Sturridge comes on for Firmino.

74: Liverpool have had 65% of the possession in the second half and that number is only likely to rise as they continue to see more of the ball. Not too much threat of a comeback though as Spurs look content to soak it up.


72: SAVE! Good link-up play from Liverpool around the box as Salah slips it through for Milner. He manages to get around Aurier, but his near-post shot is saved by Lloris.

71: No sign of any more changes from Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp has a pensive look as he surveys the scene. He must have feared this with Liverpool's defensive issues this season.

"What a save - brilliant shot from Coutinho. We’re sat up here
thinking it’s a goal. Strong hand, brilliant save. He [Lloris] gets up quickly as well."

69: First change for Spurs as Son makes way for Sissoko. Another very positive display from Son playing alongside Kane.

67: SAVE! What a save. Absolutely brilliant from Lloris. 
Coutinho does really well to shimmy away from a couple of challenges on the edge of the box and then get off a shot which seems to be heading into the top corner, but Lloris leaps and somehow manages to tip it onto the bar with his outstretched hand.

66: Liverpool are really struggling - as they have done all match - to deal with Spurs' pace on the break. Eriksen flicks on for Kane and he senses a hat-trick as he cuts inside on the edge of the box and has a shot, but his effort is well blocked.

64: This stat says plenty about Liverpool's defensive problems this season.

63: SHOT! Haven't seen too much of Eriksen today in a deeper role, and he can't hit the target with a shot from the edge of the box.


All over at the Etihad, City win again, and City score lots of goals again.
Burnley were in the game until the 72nd minuite - Sergio Aguero equalled City's all-time goalscoring record with a first-half penalty - but late goals by Otamendi and Sane wrapped up the victory.
That's a club-record 11 straight wins in all competitions for Pep Guardiola's side - and they are five points clear at the top after Man Utd's defeat at Huddersfield.

90+2: CHANCE! It should be four! Sane gets away again - from the exact position he scored earlier in the game - but he sends his effort wide of the far post.

90: THREE minutes of added time.

88: We are just drifting towards a conclusion at the Etihad - City fans will no doubt have an eye on Manchester United's result too.
They are currently 2-1 down at Huddersfield. As it stands, City will be five points clear at the top of the table.

85: SUB! Ashley Westwood comes on for Defour for Burnley.

84: SAVE! Jesus wants a goal and draws a fine save from Pope after good work by Walker down the right. The full-back actually picked out Sane in the middle, who cleverly let it run for David Silva but the Spaniard's touch was poor.

82: SUB! Kevin De Bruyne gets a round of applause as he is withdrawn, replaced by Ilkay Gundogan.

81: Burnley were in the game after 72 minutes and barely three minutes later City were out of sight. The league leaders have not been at their best today but are still winning 3-0. That's ominous for the chasing pack.

79: SUB! Fernandinho is replaced by Yaya Toure for the hosts.

77: SUB! Aguero is replaced by Gabriel Jesus. So no record-breaking goal today.

Stunning from the Premier League leaders.
Aguero's lovely flick around the corner frees De Bruyne and you can't give the Belgian space. He picks a wonderful pass to Sane and the winger does the rest, converting past Pope.
Devastating.

That could be game over! City have their second goal and they can breathe a little easier.
Pope made a sharp save from David Silva to concede a corner and Otamendi headed home from the resulting set-piece.
Defour probably should have cleared it on the line for Burnley.

72: SUB! Gudmundsson replaces Hendrick in midfield for Burnley

70: De Bruyne turns and finds Walker down the right. The full-back is a growing influence on this game. He tries to pick out Aguero but Tarkowski defends the cross superbly.

67: City have just started to wrestle back control of this game after a strong start to the second half from Burnley. Sean Dyche's side will be happy with the scoreline at the moment, though. If it stays like this they can really go for it in the final stages.

63: CHANCE! Walker is picked out by Stones in midfield and the City full-back surges forward down the right. He drills a lovely cross into the middle but Aguero can't sort out his feet and it flashes wide.

62: It's just not happening for City this week. It was always going to be difficult to live up to that seven-goal demolition, especially with the Champions League game against Napoli in midweek.

59: YELLOW! Barnes raises his arm and catches Otamendi when challenging for a header.

58: CHANCE! Burnley lose possession in their own half and David Silva breaks clear. He has Sane to his left and Aguero to his right but takes the shot on from the edge of the area, lashing wide.

55: Burnley are on top over these last five minutes and they just forced their second corner in quick succession. City clear their lines but the league leaders are struggling a little bit.

53: CHANCE! Burnley pump a free-kick high into the City box and it causes chaos in wet and windy conditions. Delph tries to hook away but smashes the ball onto his own hand, prompting a Burnley penalty shout. It's not given.
YELLOW! Cork goes into the book for appealing for that penalty.

52: There's sweeping rain across the Etihad now and it looks very windy at pitch level. Burnley will hope to use these conditions to their advantage and stay in the game before coming forward in the last 20 minutes.

49: Delph tests Ederson with a short backpass but the City goalkeeper is alert to clear his lines. Burnley have started positively in this second half.

46: We are back under way for the second half.




The hosts lead at the break thanks to Sergio Aguero's penalty - a goal that puts him level with Eric Brook as City's joint all-time leading goalscorer.
Burnley have huffed and puffed but the loss of Chris Wood to injury has disrupted them.

45+2: CHANCES! A poor defensive header allows Aguero to get free in the Burnley box and you think goal - but Pope reacts brilliantly to save with his foot. The ball breaks to Bernardo Silva and his follow-up cannons off Tarkowski. Good defending.

45: THREE minutes of added time.
Both Walker and Brady are back on the pitch.

45: A couple of players are down and receiving treatment - Brady for Burnley and Walker for Manchester City. We could have a couple of minutes of stoppage time.

43: CHANCE! City come down the other end and Aguero's low shot draws a decent save from Pope. It was created by a lovely pass from De Bruyne.
YELLOW! Fernandinho then gets booked for a cynical trip on Brady to halt a Burnley counter.

42: CHANCE! City play their way into trouble, De Bruyne misplaces his pass and it's a great opportunity for Burnley - but Arfield's shot deflects off Fernandinho and out for a corner. Good pressing from the visitors.

39: SHOT! Aguero wants that goal. He gets away from Mee and Ward and then drives a shot towards the far post. He drags it slightly and Pope watches it wide.

38: Here's that record-equalling goal by Aguero.

36: Burnley win a set-piece in a promising position but Ederson commits early and punches clear bravely. The offside flag was up anyway. Still, good goalkeeping.

32: Going back to the penalty incident, a fantastic pass by David Silva found De Bruyne in the box and Pope did well to initially save from the Belgian.
The ball then broke out to Bernardo Silva and that's when the contact came with the Burnley goalkeeper. It looked soft but there was definitely a clip on Silva's ankle.


Aguero sends Pope the wrong way from the penalty spot and that's a record-equalling goal for the Argentine!
He is now level with Eric Brook at the top of Man City's all-time goalscoring chart. They both have 177 goals.
Plenty of time in this game for Aguero to break that record outright.

28: PENALTY TO CITY! Bernardo Silva goes down under the challenge of Pope in the box and Roger East points to the spot. It was a dramatic tumble by Silva but the goalkeeper did appear to catch his ankle.
The Burnley players are incensed by Silva's fall and there's a big scrap. 
YELLOW! Tarkowski and Sane get booked for their reactions.

26: That was by far City's best moment of the match. Bernardo Silva just needed to keep his effort down and that was probably an opening goal. 

23: SAVE! City come to life and Pope makes the stop! David Silva unlocks the Burnley defence with the pass for Sane, who fires a cross back to Bernardo Silva. The playmaker strikes first-time on goal but Pope beats the effort away. Good save.

19: Or not.
SUB! Wood goes down again and he will need to come off. That's a massive blow for Burnley. It could be a hamstring injury. Ashley Barnes replaces him.

18: There was some concern over Wood's hamstring after that burst forward by the Burnley man. He briefly got treatment following the break in play but is back on the pitch now. Sean Dyche breathes a sigh of relief.

16: CHANCE! A long pump forward by Cork is poorly dealt with by Walker and Wood bundles past Otamendi before Ederson rushes out to deny the Burnley forward. The follow-up falls to Arfield but the midfielder is penalised for going in late on Ederson. It was a 50-50 and the goalkeeper got the benefit of the doubt.

15: City win two corners in quick succession, the first coming after a brilliant touch by De Bruyne. He really is a special player. The second corner is cleared away by Burnley.

14: City are looking uncharacteristically sluggish in possession at the moment. There's been a couple of misplaced passes already, which is unlike them. So far, so good for Burnley.

12: City fans will be delighted to see this man back in action.

10: It's as you would expect inside the opening 10 minutes. City are having all the ball - Burnley are happy to hassle and harry - and most of the play is taking place in the middle third of the pitch.


And that's it! Full-time and Brighton have their first ever Premier League point! They will feel like they should have three, though, after hitting the post twice and playing against 10 men since the 24th minute. Fair play to Watford, though. They were resolute and even had some half-chances of their own on the break.  

90+3: Brighton head clear the free-kick..   

90+2: That's not so smart from Stephens, who clips the back of Chalobah and gives away a free-kick 30 yards out, in the right channel.  

90+1: Subs on the charge! Carrillo bombs down the right flank on the counter-attack for Watford - but Izquierdo races back to tackle him for a throw-in. 

90: Three minutes added time.  

90: Brighton change: Murphy on for Gross 

89: Brighton nearing their first-ever Premier League point here. But Watford have the ball deep in their half. and Carrillo flicks a header over the bar.  

88: An injury to Gross leads to a brief lull in hostilities. 

86: Ooooo Izquierdo catches the eye with a drive in-field and shot from distance which clips the side-netting. Good power and pace shown by the Brighton newboy there. 

84: OUCH! March catches Femenia in the head with his boot.  but Watford don't make the most of their free-kick. Brighton clear. 

83: Gray off, Deeney on for Watford 

81: More trickery from Richarlison! This time it earns a throw-in deep in Brighton territory. Watford opt to keep the ball and move it around midfield. They must be feeling the effort of playing so long with 10 men. 

80: Here comes Brighton's record signing. Knoackert off, Izquierdo on 

79: Richarlison has shown some wonderful moves today. Here, he beats Rosenior before teeing up Gray for a shot wide. 

77: This game is moving from end-to-end now. It's really stretched. Brighton are having most of the possession but Watford remain a threat on the break.

75: Duffy heads wide from the resulting corner.  

74: Good save! Knockaert tests Gomes with a powerful left-foot drive across goal.  and Watford send a teasing March corner behind for another set-piece moments later

73: Applause rings out around Vicarage Road for the late Graham Taylor.  

71: Surely now it is time for Brighton's record signing Izquierdo to get a run out? The visitors need some inspiration to make the breakthrough

68: Gomes does well to dive out and parry clear March's ball into the box, with Knoackaert lurking. 


67: Richarlison leads Watford's counter-attack downfield, lines up the shot from 25 yards..  and sends it miles over the bar.  

66: Wasted chance! March whips a cracking cross to the back post as Brighton break forward, Knoackaert is there an unmarked but gets his angles wrong, sends it back across goal and Watford clear for a corner.  

65: Knockaert finds Gross in some space in the right channel but his cross is easily dealt with by the Watford defence. Brighton have lost the edge they had towards the end of the first half. At the other end Richarlison is fouled again, this time by Stephens. Chalboah's free-kick is a good one.  but no one can quite get on the end of it. It only needed a touch!    

61: The game has gone a little stop-start right now. This time it is Rosenior getting some treatment. 

59: Dunk eventually hits the shot after Knockaert rolls it but it's deflected over by the wall.  

57: Brighton have an in-direct free-kick in the Watford penalty box. Doucoure has been penalised for a high foot as he attempts to clear, with Knockaert the man fortunate not to get a boot in the face. That looked harsh on the Hornets man though. He had to clear the danger. 
Had Doucoure made contact with Knoackaert it would have been given as a penalty. 

55: March tries his luck from range but his low left-foot drive is dragged wide.  

54: Richarlison twists and turns and draws the foul from Rosenior. Chalobah is over the free-kick but Brighton half-clear before Doucoure volleys it back into Ryan's arms.  

51: Watford defend Brighton's first corner but from a second the south coast side go close with a hooked shot from Hemed. 

50: CLOSE! Femenia does brilliantly to deny Gross! March fires in a low cross and Femenia slides in to clear ahead of the on-rushing Brighton attacker. A goal-saver.  and he's taken a blow for his troubles. Marco Silva will be hoping he hasn't lost another defender to injury!  

49: After those changes and injuries the football is back underway.  with Cleverley looping a long-range free-kick into the box, which was too easy for Ryan to claim. 


47: Oh dear. We've barely started the second half and Cathcart has pulled up with a problem. He's coming off for new boy Andre Carrillo, Watford's season-long loan signing from Benfica.  

Brighton made a change at half-time. Rosenior on for Bruno 

We're back underway!  



That's the half-time whistle which brings to an end an action-packed first-half, albeit missing a goal. 
The big news is Watford are down to 10 men, after Miguel Britos' wild lunge at Anthony Knockaert. Brighton - still searching for their first Premier League goal - have hit the post twice, once through Knockaert and then from Tomer Hemed's deflected shot.  
The visitors will fancy their chances of earning their first Premier League win in the second half.

45+2: Chalobah does well to earn a foul under pressure from Stephens. Can Watford do anything with this central free-kick before the break.  no Brighton head clear.  

45+1: We've got three minutes added on. 

45: Gomes comes for Knockaert's free-kick but he's not convincing, with the ball clipping off his finer tips and out for a corner. The ball eventually falls to March on the edge of the box, but he volleys wide.  

45: Brighton are awarded a free-kick deep in Watford territory after Femenia handles a Knockaert cross.   

43: As half-time approaches it is Brighton on the front foot. After being under the cosh for most of the opening period, the match has shifted since Britos' sending off.  

41: Great wing play from Solly March, who dances past a couple of challenges before sending the ball across the six-yard box. No Brighton player there to turn it in, though.  

39: Another foul from Bruno on Richarlison, who barges the Brazilian to the floor. The Brighton defender is already on a yellow and is testing referee Graham Scott's patience.  

38: CLOSE! Chalobah drills a low, long-range shot just wide of the Brighton upright

37: BRIGHTON HIT THE POST AGAIN! Solly March clips in a low cross from the left and Hemed's shot flicks off Kabasele and onto the post.

36: Since Britos has been sent off, Watford have gone to a 4-4-1 formation, with Gray leading the line, Femenia at left-back and sub Cathcart at right-back.  

34: Brighton go up the other end and immediately win a corner of their own. Gross takes and Dunk heads it wide. He was under pressure and stretching. Not the easiest chance.  


Blimey. Southampton got there in the end but they made it hard for themselves. They were 2-0 up and cruising with a man advantage but Hernandez struck twice to draw brave West Ham level. That looked to be it, but Zabaleta gave away a late penalty and Austin finished with the last kick of the game. Stay tuned for the highlights. You won't want to miss them.

So cruel on West Ham.. !
Austin steps up and cool as you like, sends Hart the wrong way. The striker once rejected by the Hammers has come back to haunt them. Crazy scenes. 

90: PENALTY TO SOUTHAMPTON!!! Zabaleta punished for a shove on Yoshida...

89: CROSSBAR!! Redmond jinks one way and then the other. He pings one at goal from 22 yards. Fonte gets his body in the way but it deflects like an arrow towards goal. The ball clips the bar and goes over. So close.

87: GOAL. NO DISALLOWED! Soares dinks a ball towards the back post. Fonte wins an important header but the ball skies up into the air. Long leaps and heads in from close range but Bertrand had fouled Hart. Correct call. 


84: Groans from the home fans. Tadic sends a cross from deep well beyond his front men. Out for a goal kick. 


80: Soares beats Cresswell down the right with a smart turn of pace. He's about to cross but Hernandez tracks the run and makes a fine tackle. He's been everywhere for the Hammers today. 

77: CLOSE! Redmond cuts in from the right and decides to go himself. Hart scrambles to his right but the ball goes into the side netting. 
78: SUBS! Long and Austin are on. Gabbiadini and Davis off. 

74: SUB! Rice is replaced by Obiang - where will this game take us next?

THEY'VE DONE IT!!
From 2-0 down with 10-men, West Ham are level! And they deserve it!
Cresswell pings over a sensational ball into the middle. Sakho attacks it and Forster pushes it onto the crossbar. The ball drops inside the six-yard box and Hernandez smashes it home from close range. What a finisher!

70: Saints still in control of this game but need that third goal. 
Ward Prowse gets down the right but his cross is cleared behind by Fonte. 

67: SUBS! Antonio and Ayew both replaced as Bilic freshens it up. Fernandes and Sakho on in their place.

62: SAVE!! Tadic cuts in off the right wing and fires an effort from 20 yards. Hart reads it and pushes the ball to safety. 
64: West Ham looking to utilize any set-piece opportunities here. Cresswell hangs a ball up into the box and Fonte tries to loop a header towards the far corner.. but it goes well wide. 

57: Good noise from the travelling faithful in the away end. Despite being a man down, their side aren't out of this. Probing away.
60: CROSSBAR!! Gabbiadini drops his shoulder and finds half a yard from 30 yards. He tries his luck with a punchy effort. It flies through the air and clips the crossbar with Hart at full stretch. Wonderful effort. 

54: PENALTY APPEAL! Antonio flexes his muscles and launches a massive throw into the box. Ayew wins the first ball and it deflects off Stephens' arm. West Ham appeal en masse. but nothing given. Lee Mason didn't have a clear view. 

51: CHANCE! Soares again races away down the right flank and into the box. He's got options in the middle but decides to power one at the near post. He gets it all wrong. Into the side netting. 
52: Hernandez, who has been excellent, makes space down the left and whips a low cross which needs Forster to push away for a corner. 

47: Saints again target the West Ham left with Tadic. He feeds Soares who swings a ball in but Hart comes and collects. 
49: An innovative short-corner is worked to Davis about 22 yards out. He looks for his big men at the back post but over-hits the cross.

45: We are back. No changes for either team. West Ham get the game back underway..........


HT: Well, that was fun. Three goals and incidents galore. Gabbiadini gave the hosts the lead in a feisty opening where Tadic could have seen red for a reckless foul on Hernandez. A red card was shown minutes later to Arnautovic who stupidly elbowed Stephens. Saints then doubled their lead through a Tadic penalty and the game looked over. But Hernandez has kept West Ham alive with a poached effort. See you in 15.

Hello there. We have a game on.
Antonio does fantastically to make space about 22 yards out. His effort is spooned away by Forster but guess who's there hoovering up the bits and pieces? Yes, the Little Pea. He's back! 

40: Tadic and Soares are linking up beautifully down the right. The Serb finds his mate with a clever ball and Fonte clears for a corner, which comes to nothing. 
42: CHANCE!! Redmond's cross is deflected into the path of Davis who was quicker than Fonte. He's only 15 yards out but blazes an effort well wide. 

More lack of concentration from West Ham have cost them. Fonte's foul leaves Tadic with a chance from the spot. It's a horrendous penalty, straight down the middle but luckily for the Saints man, Hart decides to dive out of the way. The ball pings off Hart's foot and into the net. Damage limitation for West Ham here. 

PENALTY TO SOUTHAMPTON!!! Fonte pulls back Davis. It's all going wrong for the Hammers...

RED CARD!! Arnautovic sees red for an elbow on Stephens.
How stupid can you get? Clearly frustrated after getting a whack a few minutes ago, Arnautovic leaves a blatant elbow into the throat of Stephens as he was passing out from the back. No hesitation from Lee Mason.

28: Saints celebrate in the sunshine. Been an even game though. One clinical finish the difference. 

26: Getting a bit feisty here.
Lemina leaves an elbow on Arnautovic as they both attack the ball. The play develops and Noble slides in on Lemina. He puts a boot right into the shin on the Saints man. Luckily for him, the referee had already stopped play for Arnautovic to get treatment. No cards shown.



22: CHANCE!! Class from Hernandez. He whips a sensational low cross into the six yard box for Arnautovic, who gets the run on Soares. He meets the cross with a diving header from eight yards but Forster makes a brave block away. Positive signs going forward for the Hammers.

19: Tadic is now down with a knee injury following that latest foul he committed. He's off receiving treatment. 
20: SHOT! Davis finds space about 25 yards out. He has a dig. Straight at Hart. Easy save.

14: OUCH!!! The ball bounces by the dugouts to Hernandez and in flies Tadic with a high, reckless challenge that nearly cuts the Mexican in two. He looked out of control to me, but the referee deems it worthy of just a yellow card. Lucky boy.
16: Tadic looks like he got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning. He leaves another needless tackle on Arnautovic. No card - but surely that's his last chance.

13: Saints look very speedy in possession. Soares swings a ball in from the right which is turned on by Redmond for Gabbiadini. The Italian is lurking with intent but Hart is out quickly to mop up the danger. 

Out of nothing. Redmond slings a tasty ball down the side and the Italian is onto it like a flash. He takes a touch then fires a lovely finish across Hart, who got close but not close enough. Deadly finish. 
It's their first goal here since James Ward-Prowse netted in a 3-1 win over Crystal Palace in April. Drought over!

9: CHANCE!! Antonio threads a wonderful ball into Arnautovic, who makes a clever run off the left wing. He's in down the right-edge of the box but screws a low effort three yards wide. Should have gone across the goalkeeper.

6: Too many passes going astray here. West Ham trying to use the power of Antonio and Arnautovic off Hernandez but no joy as yet. Saints trying to pass their way through midfield. 
8: Overlap down the West Ham left. Soares gets to the by-line but the ball runs out of play. First signs from the hosts. 

3: Sloppy start by both teams. Rice sends his first pass straight out of play - early nerves from the youngster.

1: KICK-OFF!! Southampton gets the game underway. Lee Mason is the man in the middle. 

Lots of love for Jose Fonte from the Southampton players and
a big embrace between Joe Hart and Fraser Forster. 
Here come the teams…
Ogbonna replaces the injured Reid.

The players have headed back down the tunnel and we are close to kick-off. Still no news on Reid's replacement...

Bad news for West Ham. Winston Reid has broken down in the warm-up. In fact, he's being stretchered off. Looks like an ankle injury.
Not sure how it happened - we'll have news on his replacement shortly. 

Declan Rice makes his first ever senior start against
Southampton.
The 18-year-old captained the U23s to promotion last season
and also received a call to train with Martin O’Neil’s senior Republic of
Ireland squad ahead of their summer fixtures with Mexico, Uruguay and Austria.
He came off the bench against Manchester United last weekend
and looked very composed in midfield. Big day for the young man. 

I thought for 25 minutes West Ham were comfortable against Manchester United last weekend, but after 2-0 it was cringeworthy and worrying. If they lose this game then they have another two away games to come as well.
I heard Karren Brady on The Debate on Sky Sports saying they have four away games now but then three home games in a row in March - wow!
You need to get off to a good start in the Premier League and not be behind the eight ball. Teams at the bottom won't win five games on the spin and I think it's worrying for West Ham. I didn't like what I saw. There are ways of losing matches and at the end against Man Utd it could have been anything.
Southampton had chances last week against Swansea, like that sitter Maya Yoshida missed at the back post, and I think they will get off the mark.


Now time for the Saints boss. How's he feeling ahead of the game?


Slaven Bilic stops for a chat to talk about his team selection...


FT: It's all over. Stoke hold on for all three points and a brilliant win over Arsenal. New signing Jese Rodriguez was the match-winner for hosts, scoring just after half-time as Mark Hughes' men picked up their first points of the season.

90+5: Oxlade-Chamberlain fires a pass to Mustafi, who is offside. That appears to be it for Arsenal's chances of an equaliser.

90+4: CHANCE! Monreal drills a cross towards Giroud, who beats Shawcross to the ball. However, the Frenchman heads wide of the target.

90+3: The ball is fired into the Stoke penalty area and Giroud rises highest knock the ball down into a dangerous area. There's no-one there for Arsenal as Stoke clear their lines.

90+2: Arsenal work the ball to Mustafi on the right flank and the German slices his cross into the crowd. That pretty much sums up Arsenal's night.

90: There will be FIVE minutes of added time.  

87: Play is back underway and Pieters is back on for the hosts.

85: Pieters is still down and receiving treatment.

83: Pieters go down as Mustafi slides in with a challenge. Pieters stays down but referee Andre Marriner waves play on, much to the bemusement of the home fans.

79: SUBS! Here come the changes. Walcott and Iwobi replace Xhaka and Lacazette. 

78: Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot is deflected behind for another Arsenal corner. Mustafi rises highest but powers his header wide of the target.

77: It appears Arsenal are preparing the final throw of the dice. Iwobi and Walcott look to be coming on for the Gunners.  

75: CORNER! Ozil's corner is flicked away to safety by Zouma. The on loan defender is then called upon to shackle Lacazette and he does brilliantly, standing his ground to win his side a goal kick.

73: NO GOAL! Arsenal think they have an equaliser as Giroud's flick falls to Lacazette, who powers the ball high into the roof of net. However, the flag is up for offside and it's a very, very tight call.

71: SUB! Jese's run out of gas. He goes off to a standing ovation and is replaced by Sobhi.

70: CHANCE! Oxlade-Chamberlain picks out Lacazette in the box but the Frenchman's touch lets him down. Stoke clear only as far as Ozil, who powers the ball goalwards but his effort is brilliantly blocked by Fletcher. Ozil gets another go though, curling the ball inches wide of the post.

68: SAVE! Giroud's first touch releases Welbeck, who takes one touch to many, allowing Butland to come off his line and make a smart save.

67: SUB! Here's the change! Kolasinac is replaced by Giroud and we'll have a change of shaped for the Gunners as well.

66: Arsenal are keeping the ball well but Stoke are keeping their shape well at the moment.


64: Arsenal are preparing to make a change and it looks like Giroud will be the man to come on.

63: WIDE! Fletcher slices a shot and it falls for Choupo-Moting, who volleys into the side netting.

62: SAVE! Pieters whips the ball in from the left and Berahino gets his head to the ball, forcing Cech to tip the ball over the crossbar.

61: CHANCE! Mustafi pokes the ball into the box, picking out Ramsey. The Welshman steers the ball goalwards but it's straight at Butland, who makes a comfortable save.

60: CHANCE! Ozil's cross picks out Welbeck. the England forward has time and space to pick his spot with a header, but he gets it all wrong as the ball bounces off his shoulder and over the crossbar.

59: Since the goal Stoke have dropped deep and are inviting Arsenal on to them. That could be a dangerous game for Mark Hughes' side.

57: CHANCE! Bellerin gets a shot away and Butland spills it. Welbeck charges in but the bounce of the ball doesn't fall for him as Stoke clear behind for a corner.

55: Ramsey heads Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross back towards Welbeck but Zouma is well positioned to cut the ball out. However, Arsenal want a penalty as the ball bounces up and hits Zouma's arm but it looks to be accidental. Play on!

54: The goal has lifted the mood at the bet365 Stadium. the home fans are now cheering every tackle and every block.

52: Welbeck shows his strength, barging Diouf off the ball. He picks out Bellerin on the edge of the box and continues his run but the return pass is poor and the ball runs out for a goal kick.

50: Can Arsenal find a response? The substitutes are now out warming up so we can expect to see Giroud and co sooner rather than later.

49: That goal has livened the bet365 Stadium up as Delilah rings around the ground.

Jese starts the move, picking out Berahino just outside the Arsenal box. The Spaniard continues his run and gets the ball back before firing the ball across Cech and into the bottom corner. What a start to Jese's Stoke career!

46: KICK-OFF! Stoke get us back underway.



HT: Andre Marriner brings the first-half to a close. Neither side have been at their best but both goalkeepers have been in the action with Jack Butland in particular making impressive saves to deny Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck. Jese has been bright for Stoke but both managers will be wanting more from their sides after the break.

45+2: It's Butland's turn to punch. He's alert to the danger, getting to the ball first as Oxlade-Chamberlain clips the ball over the top for Ramsey. The whistle's gone though for a high foot against Ramsey.

45+1: Fletcher sends a long ball into the box but Cech spots the danger, charging off his line to make a comfortable catch.

45: There will be TWO minutes of added time at the end of the first-half.

43: Play is back underway with Diouf back on the field.

41: Diouf is down as Arsenal look to go forward. The Gunners initially do not put the ball out but after a while Monreal fires it out for a throw-in which allows Diouf to get treatment.

40: Allen gets in behind the Arsenal defence but his touch takes him away from goal, which allows the visitors to regain their shape. The chance disappears for Stoke as Arsenal bring the ball away.

37: Oxlade-Chamberlain breaks for Arsenal. He has support but takes the shot on, firing wide of Butland's far post.

35: SAVE! Xhaka can strike them from distance but this time, it's a weak effort which is easily saved by Butland.

33: WIDE! Ozil turns sharply in the Stoke penalty area before sliding the ball back for Bellerin to strike. It's a horrible effort from the Spaniard, who strikes the ball high and wide of the goal.

32: CHANCE! The ball falls to Choupo-Moting, who stands the ball up for Shawcross. The defender rises unmarked but can only head the ball over the crossbar.

Could that have been the opener for Arsenal? See how close Ramsey went. Hit play.

31: It's a better effort from Jese. Diouf gets his head to the ball but cannot make good enough contact to trouble Cech.


FULL-TIME! West Brom maintain their winning start to the season by securing a narrow 1-0 win over Burnley at Turf Moor.,
It isn't likely to be a game that lives long in the memory of anyone watching it but it is an important result for Tony Pulis and his men nonetheless.
Robson-Kanu was the hero for the visitors, coming off the bench to score before being sent off shortly afterwards. 
That result means West Brom are 2nd in the table behind Manchester United.

90: There's a bit of a flare-up in the West Brom area as Barnes shoves Foster over as he collected the ball with his teammates surrounding him demanding to know why he took such a course of action.
Martin Atkinson responds with the first yellow card of the match.

87: Burnley have what feels like the 1,000th corner of the game and eventually work the ball into the area onto the head of Barnes who nods his effort over. 

86: Hegazi flies in to prevent a Vokes shot heading towards goal but the ball ricochets to Hendrick who can't control his shot, curling the ball over the top of the bar. Burnley's finishing has been so wasteful today.

83: Pulis has quickly made a change in an attempt to protect the lead, bringing on Rondon in place of Field.

81: RED CARD! Incredible scenes here as the goalscoer Robson-Kanu receives a straight red card for appearing to throw his arm into the face of Lowton!
The Welshman was chasing after a long ball and challenged the right back but he certainly led with his arm there and it was probably the right decision.

80: Half-chance for Burnley as the ball drops into the path of Barnes from Ward's knockdown but he swivels and volleys harmlessly over Foster's goal.

79: Field nods away an inswinging free-kick from Burnley from the touchline and the ball bobbles invitingly into the path of Lowton who slashes the ball high and wide of the goal.

78: Barnes, who has only just come on, suffers an awkward landing as he leaps to challenge a high ball with Hegazi, who unceremoniously cleared him out as well as the ball.

76: Dyche is looking increasingly animated on the touchline as he tries to get his team going.
He's made two changes with Walters on in place of Brady and Barnes replacing Gudmundsson.


73: So how do Burnley respond to that? They've been second best in truth during this second half and have barely tested Foster all game. Will Dyche copy Pulis in turning to his bench in search of a goal?

And finally we have a goal!
In keeping with the game it was a scrappy one as a high, hopeful ball was nodded on by Phillips into the path of Robson-Kanu who brushed past Tarkowski and slid the ball past Heaton at his near post with a confident finish.
Pulis will be delighted that his change has come off so quickly!

66: Pulis seems to have tweaked his formation slightly following that change by going from a 4-5-1 to a 4-4-2 with Robson-Kanu playing right up alongside Rodriguez and Field shifting out to the left flank.

63: Good footwork from Hendrick sees him shift the ball away from Dawson and draw a foul right on the edge of the area.
Brady, who scored a free-kick goal on his debut for Burnley against Chelsea last season, is standing over it with Defour also looking on with interest.
The Irishman won the power struggled but slammed his shot straight into the wall with Ward's follow-up also being deflected to safety.

61: Right on cue a change is being made as Robson-Kanu is being introduced for McClean who does not look best pleased at the decision, shaking his head and muttering under his breath as he makes his way off the pitch.

60: An hour gone now and no side really looks any closer to breaking the deadlock.
Both managers have options on the bench so will we see Walters, Chadli or Rondon coming on anytime soon?

58: Brunt whips a corner in but it is well defended by Burnley. A hame of head tennis has ensued between both sides, I counted eight headers there but it quite easily could have been more.
Someone needs to take a grip of this game in midfield.

56: Phillips opens up some space for himself infield from the right wing but gets well underneath a left-foot shot that ends up high in the stands behind Heaton's goal.

53: From yet another corner Defour flashes a volley towards the goal and Hendrick gets his head on it in an attempt to divert it into the corner but it flies just wide of the post.

50: West Brom have started promisingly in this second half without really creating an opening. Burnley are looking to get a foothold on the game in midfield and earn a free-kick as Brunt clatters into Gudmundsson.

48: Phillips is looking threatening here and he jinks past Ward with ease before being brought down on the edge of the box by the Irishman's trailing leg. 
Brunt hovers over the ball for the free-kick and whips a menacing delivery into the box that evades everyone and floats harmlesly behind for a goal kick.
That was neither a shot nor a cross from Brunt.

46: OFFSIDE! Livermore thought he had given his side the lead as his shot deflected off Mee into the back of the net but the flag was raised as Rodriguez was interfering with play from an offside position.
Its been a lively start to the second half, at least.

45: The second half is underway and Burnley immediately make inroads into Albion's box with Gudmundsson picking out Vokes who fires the ball way over the top.


Half-time! And the referee brings the half to a close.
The first half hour was a largely underwhelming affair with both teams guilty of ceding possession too easily but the game livened up in the final 15 minutes with Field and Mee going close to scoring their respective sides.
Chances from opening play have been few and far between and it looks as though set-pieces will be required to break the deadlock.

44: One minute of added time at the end of this half, probably due to Hegazi requiring treatment on a couple of occasions.

42: CHANCE! Unbelievable miss from Mee as he somehow manages to nod the ball wide from just two yards out with the goal gaping!
What an opportunity for the defender who will not have an easier chance to score all season.

40: CHANCE! A Phillips corner is fizzed into the area and evades everyone at the front post before glancing off the back of Field's head from inside the six-yard-box.
That was by far the best chance of the half but the youngster was unable to re-adjust his body to get the required contact on his header. In fact, he knew absolutely nothing about that.
That's a let-off for Burnley.

39: It has been a bruising half for West Brom's centre backs as this time Dawson is hobbling around after he went up for a challenge inside Burnley's penalty box.


38: CHANCE! Cork displays some nice footwork to evade a couple of West Brom challenges before feeding the ball into the path Brady who whips an inviting ball into the box that was begging to be converted by Vokes who somehow fails to make contact.
Replays suggested that the the Welshman was offside but it didn't look as though the flag went up. That has to go down as a big chance for the in-form striker.

35: Corner to West Brom. Nyom knocked a hopeful ball into the box and Tarkowski and Mee combined to head the ball away with Rodriguez for company.
Brunt bends the ball into the near-post and it is cleared for another corner by Lowton. The second cross comes in but Vokes does well to get the ball clear.

33: Lowton loops an uninviting backpass in the vague direction of Heaton who returns the favour with McClean hunting down the loose ball.
Eventually, it all worked out for Burnley but they almost played themselves into trouble needlessly again.

31: Brady skips down the left wing before digging out an inviting cross from the byline which finds Gudmundsson at the far post but his header under pressure is tame and easily picked up by Foster.
We have our first save of the game, folks!

30: CHANCE! Vokes beats Dawson in the air to head the ball into the path of Gudmundsson who controls the ball and shifts it onto his favoured left foot before bending an effort just wide of the far post.
Foster was scrambling across his goalline there which suggests he was worried that might be sneaking in.

28: Phillips looks to break down the right touchline but his run is halted by Mee in the box who clears.
West Brom are growing into the game following some sustained pressure from Burnley but haven't really troubled Heaton in goal just yet.

25: The home side are just starting to turn up the pressure a bit with a couple of corner kicks.
From the second there is a goulmouth scramble before the ball drops to Hendrick who sees an effort blocked away from danger.
The ball is hoisted back into the box but Foster comes to claim it under pressure from Brady.


22: Phillips chases down a lofted ball over the top from Rodriguez but Mee is there to bundle the ball back to Heaton in goal, Phillips was convinced that there was a back-pass there but the referee isn't interested.

19: Welcome to the Premier League, Hegazi!
The Egyptian is spreadeagled across the Turf Moor pitch after receiving another blow to the head, this time from a Burnley player.
He's been patched up just above his right eye and makes his way back onto the pitch.

18: Hendrick finds himself surrounded by four West Brom players near the touchline but somehow emerges from the situation with a free-kick as Field is penalised.
There's been a lot of endeavour but little in the way of quality so far.

16: Cork passes the ball into Hendrick on the edge of the box and he unleashes a half-volley just wide of Foster's post.
That's his second shot from distance and West Brom will perhaps look to close him down more quickly next time as he looks the most likely to make something happen.

13: Burnley are starting to take control of the game with Cork and Defour enjoying plenty of touches in the middle.
Brady links up with his Republic of Ireland teammate Ward on the left flank but his cross is blocked for a throw-in.
Aside from McClean's early chance neither team has been able to make inroads into the penalty area.

11: Just looking at the replays now and it was actually Dawson who caught Hegazi as both centre backs went up for the same ball. Hopefully their lines of communication will improve from now on.

10: There's a slight issue for West Brom's man mountain Hegazi as he has a bit of blood pouring out of a head wound. 
The Egyptian is receiving treatment on the touchline and has had to change his shirt. He looks ok to continue.

9: Both managers are animated on the touchline as Vokes and Dawson clash just inside West Brom's half but the referee isn't interested, letting the play carry on.

7: Rodriguez looks up for it today as he closes down Mee quickly, forcing him to rush his clearance and put the ball out for a throw in on the halfway line.
Perhaps it is his pressing from the front that sees him selected over Rondon this afternoon.

5: Mee clips an accurate long ball onto the chest of Vokes who cushions the ball down well for Hendrick to strike on the volley but the Irishman gets underneath it and the ball loops well over the bar.
First sniff of an opportunity for the home side.

3: The ball has spent a lot of the time in the air in the opening stages, a sign of things to come, perhaps?
Neither side has really settled into the game just yet with passes flying out of touch all over the place.


That's all from us here, many thanks for joining us. Of course, there is plenty more Premier League action to follow today which you can do so HERE.
And don't forget to check back here at 5.15pm for the match highlights from Selhurst Park. See you then!

Hear from Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino following today's victory.

Hear from Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson following the defeat.


Alan Pardew gave his assessment of Crystal Palace's performance after the game, and says he was struggling to find something positive to say on his former side. 
"For me, there was a lack of personality on the
pitch today as individuals and a team. I’m struggling to find something really
positive to say aside from Ruben Loftus-Cheek was terrific in the time he had
on the pitch and he was their best player. There were a few players I know very
well out there looking a bit short on confidence."

Jamie Redknapp thinks there are worrying times ahead for point-less Crystal Palace after their latest Premier League defeat at home to Southampton this afternooon.
"There is a huge identity crisis," the Sky Sports pundit said. "What sort of team are you?
"They will have been working all pre season under De Boer being a nice, technical side, playing out from the back with nice expansive football.
"But they did not buy the right personnel to play that way.
"And now all of a sudden they are going to have to change, and quickly under Roy Hodgson as he will want to play a completely different style of football."



At least for now, Southampton are in the European places.

Five games. No goals. No points. The worst start in Premier League history.

Mr Hodgson now knows just how tough the task facing him will be.

And there's the whistle as Crystal Palace's dismal start continues under Roy Hodgson. 
They are now the first team to have lost and failed to score in their opening five Premier League matches and the grey skies over Selhurst Park say a lot. 
It was Steven Davis' sixth minute goal that secured an important three points for Southampton, who also saw the return of Virgil van Dijk to first team football. 
Plenty of food for thought for Hodgson now as Palace remain rock bottom of the Premier League table.

90+4: It's all gone a bit quiet in the Selhurst Park stands now as Ward tries to shoot from range but it goes way over the bar. 
Not long to go until Crystal Palace lose and fail to score their opening five Premier League games.

90+3: Free kick to Southampton late on that is whipped into the back post by Ward-Prowse, and Van Dijk nearly gets his head onto it but it just runs a bit long for the returning defender. 

90+1: Another Southampton change now as Long makes way for Manolo Gabbiadini. 

90: Five minutes of added time at Selhurst Park. Can Crystal Palace find the goal they need?.  As you can imagine, they're camped around the Southampton box at the moment. 

89: SAVE!! Not a bad effort at all from Soares there as he bursts forward and goes for goal, but his snapshot effort is palmed away by Hennessey. 

87: Here he comes..  Van Dijk comes on for Tadic. It's his first Saints appearance since January 22nd.

86: NO PENALTY! A half shout from the home fans as a shot from Sako hits Lamina on the arm, but Bobby Madley waves away the claims. 

85: A change for Southampton as James Ward-Prowse comes on for Redmond. 
Virgil Van Dijk being readied too.  

84: Some decent crosses into the box from Palace there as Ward fires in from the right flank, searching for Benteke. Southampton clear before Towsend puts another ball in but some good defending from Bertrand means Sako cannot connect. 

82: Another card from Bobby Madley, this time for Dann who pulls Long back as he looked to be on the break.
Five players have now been booked for the hosts, and one more would see a reproach from the FA.

80: Crystal Palace have now gone the longest period of time without scoring at the start of a season, beating the previous record set by Newcastle in the 2005/06 season. 
They scored in the 78th minute of their fifth game during that campaign - with Palace now beating this and counting. 

79: Another change for Palace as Loftus-Cheek is replaced by Bakary Sako. It seems like a strange decision to take off the Chelsea loanee who has been one of the better attacking players so far. 

77: Free kick for Palace and Long goes into the book after a series of tackles from the visiting players, before Cabaye is eventually clipped. 
The Frenchman lofts the ball into the box and it meets the head of Ward, but the effort goes wide. 

76: Cabaye launches the ball into the box but it is cleared by the first defender. It looked like the blonde-tipped hair of Lamina from here. 

75: Frustrated jeers from the home fans now as Crystal Palace try to find a way through the Southampton defence, but are constantly being pushed back. 
A free kick to the hosts now though as Redmond catches Ward in the face with an arm. Puncheon and Cabaye over it.  

His first Premier League game in five years and he's 1-0 down at home to Southampton in the rain.

72: Free kick to Southampton as Townsend and Bertrand tussle on the right touchline. The Crystal Palace man is not best pleased with the decision, and doesn't shake Bertrand's outstretched hand in the aftermath. He may not have seen it, but Townsend is certainly not happy.

69: A rare sight this game as Romeu and Lemina both make mistakes that allows Loftus-Cheek to power into the box, but his eventual shot is blocked as Southampton clear. 
Meanwhile, Palace make their first chance with Luka Milivojevic coming on for McArthur. 

Palace now 14/1 to win this one with Saints at 1/3. Jason Puncheon is one of several now in the book and is 9/1 from 8/1 to be sent off.

68: I said the surface would get slick with the rain and there is a succession of free kicks for Southampton, with the latest seeing McArthur going into the book after a tackle on Bertrand. 

66: Free kick for Palace there as Long clatters into the back of Schlupp at the right corner flag.
The striker had done well to set Tadic away down the right flank but the Palace defender put in a firm tackle on the Saints midfielder to stop him in his tracks. 
It was then Long who tracked back to try and win the ball back again, but ended up conceding the free kick. He wasn't too happy about the decision either. 

64: A cute bit of play from Tadic there as he tries to slip the ball into the path of the on-running Davis, but Dann is there to see the ball behind for a corner. 

62: Free kick to Southampton as there's a tussle on the right touchline, with Puncheon penalised for a foul on Soares. 
He is given a talking to by Bobby Madley with a yellow card already to his name. 

61: WIDE! Not a bad effort from Crystal Palace as Cabaye picks out the run of Benteke into the box and lofting the ball in his direction, but his header directs the ball wide of the top corner. 
There's a thumbs up from the striker and he could maybe have done better with that.

59: The rain is absolutely hammering down in South London now, meaning the surface will become slick as the game goes on. Southampton are trying for another goal now as the pendulum swings in their direction, and this game could do with a bit of a spark.

57: As the passage of play comes to an end, Ward goes into the book for an earlier tackle. 

56: Bobby Madley signals for Southampton to play on after a foul, and it's a good advantage for the visitors. 
Tadic whips a ball in from the right flank but Puncheon sees it out before Long and Redmond both sees their chances blocked by the Palace defence. 

53: Not too much in terms of chances for Southampton in the half yet, with Palace certainly looking the more likely to score.

50: A booking for Puncheon now as he clatters into a challenge on Tadic and sees a yellow for his troubles.

49: CLOSE! A better start from Palace and they have two chances to equalise!
Loftus-Cheek whips a cross in from the right-hand side but it's smuggled away by the Southampton defence, nicking off the heel of Romeu to glance wide.
Palace then come again as Schlupp sets up the incoming Puncheon by similarly to Benteke's first half effort, it's straight at Forster who comes off his line to make a superb save.

46: Southampton get the game back underway at Selhurst Park.

Former Crystal Palace and Southampton manager Alan Pardew had this to say on the Eagles' shape in the first half, chatting to Simon Thomas and Jamie Redknapp in the Sky Sports studio this afternoon.
"The set-up of the team is somewhat constricting Palace. Sometimes when you go in as a manager in the first few days, you talk about shape and
getting back in your position but Palace have done that too literally. 
"They’ve
gone straight back into shape and therefore give Southampton far too much
space. That has created so many problems for them. He’s going to have to change
the shape of this team."

Christian Benteke is a 13/2 Price Boost (from 6/1) to score the next goal as Palace look to get back into the contest.

Will Roy Hodgson and his newly-assembled backroom team of Ray Lewington and Steven Reid be able to guide Palace out of their slump?

Not the best start for Roy Hodgson as Southampton lead at the break thanks to Steven Davis' early goal. 
Southampton have looked composed throughout the first half, especially in possession, but Crystal Palace have had the best chances to take the lead since the goal. 
Christian Benteke and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have gone close but they are yet to find the breakthrough. Will we see changes from Hodgson at the break?.  Stay tuned to find out!

45: One minute added on. 
Redmond shoots from range but Hennessey collects well before Schlupp flicks on for Townsend at the other end who also tries for a late equaliser but it flies past the post.

44: Nearly a superb move from Southampton as Redmond bursts away down the left flank, playing a one-two with Davis before sliding the ball through the box. 
Tadic then tries a powerful shot from the top of the box but it slams into the body of a Crystal Palace defender before going wide.


FT: All over at the King Power, and it's a first win of the 2017/18 season for Leicester! 
Okazaki handed the Foxes the perfect start, and they didn't look back from then on. Maguire rose highest to double Leicester's lead in the second half and it was ultimately a comfortable game for Shakespeare's men.
Highlights here from 5.15pm.

90+2: Vardy in the wars again and now he's hobbling off gingerly. This does not look good.  He's replaced by Gray for the last couple of minutes.

90: Vardy goes down all too easily in the box (we've seen that before) but the referee rightly says no.
It's  then catching practice for Schmeichel, who stops March's effort from distance.
Four minutes added on.  

89: Mahrez with the ball out wide once more, but this time his tricks can only lead to a Brighton goal-kick. The Algerian may continue to be linked away from the King Power, but he's been one of Leicester's standout players this afternoon. 

86: Vardy taking his time to get back to his feet. Took an accidental hand to the face from Dunk after going down from a hefty challenge.
Thumbs up though and the referee waves him back onto the field of play. 

84: Brighton look to counter but it's a poor cross in from March, with Schmeichel collecting it. Vardy is down after clattering into Dunk - he'll just need a minute to recover from that.

82: Late challenge from Simpson catches Murphy, and Knockaert looks to pump one into the box.
It finds Dunk, but he can only glance it out for a goal-kick.

80: Knockaert tries to wriggle his way past a few players but it's Vardy back on defensive duty who makes a terrific interception. The Foxes can't quite counter though as a ball for Mahrez goes too long.
Just 10 minutes plus stoppages for Brighton now. 

78: Corner to Brighton as they look to get one back here, but it's a free-kick to Leicester that follows as Morgan goes down under pressure from Duffy. 

75: A job well done from Okazaki, who goes off to a standing ovation. On comes Slimani to try and find Leicester a third in the final 15 minutes. 

73: SAVE! A chance from nothing as Hemed cuts onto his right and unleashes a low effort from 25 yards out, but Schmeichel gets down to make the save. Smart stop.
BLOCKED! Down the other end, Albrighton picks out Mahrez but Dunk blocks the attempt. 



66: Bruno gives another foul away as Maguire worms his way towards the edge of the Brighton box. Once more, Mahrez and Albrighton stand over the ball.
It's Albrighton to take but his strike deflects out for a corner - which Ryan goes on to collect comfortably.
Meanwhile, Hemed comes on to replace Murray.

63: CHANCE! Murray has to do better here. The cross comes in from Gross but the forward can't get a proper connection onto the ball.
And Gross is now off with Knockaert coming on to face his former club. Great reception he gets too from both sets of fans.

61: Almost a devastating counter attack from Leicester after Schmeichel claims the ball from Brighton's corner.
Vardy brings it forward and then it's Mahrez who dances his way past a couple of chances, but his Maradona twirl sees him lose possession in the end. He's certainly enjoying himself out there though.

58: Mahrez is simply too quick for Suttner and the Algerian has the chance to whip the ball in. It's a dangerous ball in but it's headed away.
Knockaert readying himself on the bench, and Brighton have a corner.  

Maguire scores on his home debut for Leicester!
Both Maguire and Morgan are there at the back-post to meet Mahrez's cross, but it's the former who gets his head onto it.
It wasn't the cleanest of headers though, and it appears to glance off his own arm as it goes in. But that goes unnoticed and now Brighton have a mountain to climb.

53: Now it's a free-kick to Leicester 35 yards out with Bruno shoving Albrighton off the ball. Morgan ventures forward, as does Maguire.
Well worked free-kick between Mahrez and Albrighton, and the cross is turned away for a corner.  

51: Brighton enjoying plenty of possession now and Morgan goes into the book after a late tackle on Murphy. Free-kick to Brighton 35 yards out.
Gross' cross is terrible tough and fails to beat the first man.

49: Decent bit of play from Brighton and it's with Bruno out wide. His cross in is a good one but Murray can't quite bring it down.

47: Quiet start to the half. Brighton with the ball though and they'll have to take the initiative now. Might not be long before Hughton looks towards the bench.

And away we go in the second half! Brighton kick us off. Can the Seagulls get back into this one?


HT: And there's the half-time whistle. Okazaki's tap-in after 52 seconds separates the sides, but Brighton are still in this one.
Leicester looking dominant, but only have the one goal to show for it. Shakespeare will want them to put the game to bed in the second half.

45: Duffy and Okazaki collide and both will need treatment. Duffy only has eyes for the ball as he looks to get his head onto it, and he clatters into the back of Okazaki, who is up and looks okay.

43: Not much for Murray to shout about up front for Brighton. The below shot was from his offside attempt, which found the back of the net, but Schmeichel hasn't had a save to make so far. Will have to change after half-time. A couple minutes before to get one too.

41: JUST WIDE! Leicester so close to 2-0. It's Vardy who does the work down the wing this time and his ball in is met by Okazaki at the near post, but he can only get his studs onto it and send it wide. Tough angle to score from in truth.

39: OVER! Stephens nudges Albrighton off the ball, but not legally according to referee Lee Probert. Good chance for the Foxes to whip on in here.  Mahrez does so. And it then falls to James on the edge of the area, but he volleys over. 

36: Just gone a bit quiet here at the King Power in the past couple minutes. Leicester on the ball and content to play it around, try and find the killer pass. Brighton handing the ball back to them all too often in truth.

34: Leicester with a corner and Ryan can only half-punch Mahrez's cross away. Lovely skill and then strength from Fuchs earns the Foxes another corner.  but it's straight out for a goal-kick after evading everyone. 

32: Right then. The replay. Morgan's arms were behind his back as he blocked Murphy's effort, and it appeared to hit him on the side of his body. Not sure of the technical term for the area - the bit between your front and your back. 

30: Half an hour into the game and you have to give credit to Brighton for getting back into this one. Okazaki's early opener put them on the back foot but the visitors have grown in confidence and are looking stronger. Just need to find an equaliser now.

28: BLOCKED! By an arm? Brighton players and fans think so.
It's Murray who nods it down for Murphy, and his fierce volley is then blocked by a brave Morgan inside the area. Will take a replay to see where exactly that hit him.  

26: Fuchs earns Leicester a corner and it's Albrighton to take.  Brighton can only half clear it but then a Morgan handball hands the visitors a free-kick. 


24: OFFSIDE! Murray has the ball in the back of the net for Brighton, but he's a good yard offside.
Decent attempt mind on the half-volley, having been played in by March, but he was just too eager to break the line there.

22: Slight stoppage in play as Brighton 'keeper Ryan receives some treatment. It came after Ndidi slid Vardy through on goal, but it was Ryan who made it first, with Vardy clipping the Australian shotstopper in the process.
He's up though and looks fine to continue.

20: Leicester dominant here and it's Maguire on a venture forward who sees his effort blocked.
But then it's better from Brighton, as skipper Bruno gets the ball to the byline, but his low cross is caught by Schmeichel.

18: WHAT A CHANCE! Not sure how Vardy hasn't tucked this one away.
It's poor from Suttner, who gives the ball away straight to Okazaki, who in turn bursts into the box and sends in a low cross for Vardy. However, he doesn't manage to get a proper connection onto it and when the rebound falls to him he can only miskick his effort.


14: First real positive venture forward from Brighton but it only results in a blocked attempt from Murphy from outside the area.

12: Foxes fans are enjoying what they're seeing so far. Mahrez is being given too much freedom down the right, and Brighton are being way too sloppy when on the ball. Just 12 minutes gone mind, the Seagulls just looking to regroup. 


8: All Leicester here early on. Brighton a bit sloppy in possession but they're just passing it round the back to build up some confidence.
That being said, Duffy has just given the ball away for the second time in under a minute and hands the ball back to Leicester. 

5: WIDE! Leicester going for the kill early doors here, and Albrighton whips in a terrific free-kick which is headed narrowly wide by Morgan. Brighton on the ropes, but it's still early doors.

It's Okazaki who scores the opener but it's Mahrez who he has to thank here!
Mahrez weaves his way into the box before unleashing a low effort on goal, which Ryan can only parry into the path of Okazaki, who has a simple tap in from six yards out.
The Brighton goalkeeper won't be too pleased with his attempt to keep out Makrez's shot, but Leicester fans won't care!

And away we go. Okazaki kicks us off.

Teams are out. Flags are waving. Fans are chanting. Hands are being shaken.
Two minutes until kick-off.  Who are you backing?
