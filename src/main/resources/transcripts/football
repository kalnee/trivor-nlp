Man City are rampant once again at the Etihad and Sky Bet have enhanced the odds on the in-form Raheem Sterling adding to his tally from 11/4 to 3/1. Bet live on the Champions League right here.
It's all over at the Eithad and Man City make it three wins from three in the Champions League so far. Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus gave them an early 2-0 lead but after Ederson saved a Dries Mertens penalty in the first half, Amadou Diawara netted from the spot in the second half for Napoli. But it wasn't enough for the visitors to pull another goal back as Man City kept the three points.
90+3: Free kick to Man City on the left as Sane is fouled, but he takes it short to De Bruyne as the hosts look to run the clock down.
90: Five minutes of added time. 
89: SAVE! Good save from Reina as Gundogan goes for goal from the far right of the box, but the Napoli stopper is equal to it and pushes away. 
86: Free kick City as Koulibaly clatters into Jesus in the middle of the park, leaving the Man City man on the floor. A final City change and Jesus is making way anyway for Danilo.
84: Another good save from Reina at his near post as De Bruyne once again sets up Sane down the left of the box, skipping over the challenge of Allan, but his eventual shot is well blocked by the Napoli goalkeeper. 
81: CLOSE! Should that have been another for Napoli? Mertens bursts forward and spies Ederson off his line, attempting to chip the goalkeeper, but it doesn't quite come off as his effort goes well wide of the open goal.
80: Free kick in a great position for Man City as Maggio fouls Sane on the left and gets a booking for his troubles. De Bruyne takes and tries to curl it home, but Reina makes a superb save to deny Man City a third. 
78: Another Napoli change as Hamsik is replaced by Ounas. 
76: David Silva makes way now and he is replaced by Gundogan. 
75: NO GOAL! Almost the perfect response from man City as De Bruyne plays another superb pass to pick out Jesus in the box, and the Brazilian striker rounds the oncoming Reina to net - but he is flagged for offside. 
An unlikely source but he expertly dispatches his first senior goal into the bottom corner, past the outstretched hand of Ederson. Game on!
72: PENALTY NAPOLI! Oh my goodness, another Napoli penalty as Ghoulam is fouled in the box by Fernandinho after a mazy run from almost the middle of the half. No complaints about that one as the Man City man is booked. Diawara stepping up this time... 
69: Here comes the change as Sterling makes way for Bernardo Silva. Another good game from the winger this evening. Napoli also make a change with Maggio coming on for Hysajs.
68: Play is back underway and both players are patched up and back on. Meanwhile, Bernardo Silva is stripped and ready for action... 
67: A stop in play as Silva and Hysajs clash heads in a high challenge. The medics are on and both are rather bloodied but are being patched up and should be OK to continue. 
66: WHAT A BLOCK! The best chance of the second half comes for Napoli as Fernandinho clatters into a challenge on Allan, allowing Mertens to latch onto the loose ball. Ederson is out to close him down, allowing Hamsik to have a free shot on goal but Stones leaps in front of the ball to see it go behind the goal. A big block from the centre back. 
63: Zielinski goes down in the box clutching his face after taking an elbow to the face from Walker - albeit unintentionally. The referee is unmoved though, and there's not penalty given this time.
62: Some tricky feet from Reina there as he comes out of his box to collect a forward pass, dancing around Sterling before clearing, only for it to go out of play to jeers from the home fans. 
60: Free kick to City as the captains find themselves in a midfield tussle, with Hamsik penalised for a foul on Silva. It's deep, though, and little is made from it. 
58: An absolutely superb run from Callejon there, racing into an acre of space in the box as Hamsik's cross floats into the box, but it is too long for the forward to get onto the end of. 
57: A change from Napoli now as Insigne is replaced by Allan. The forward looks to be limping somewhat as he leaves the field, which will be a worry for the visitors. Meanwhile, Allan's introducing produces a ripple of laughs from the home fans. An amusing substitution, if you will. 
55: Another dangerous counter from City as Sterling finds Sane down the right of the box. He tries to create room for himself and goes for goal, but it is poked wide by the foot of a Napoli defender. City have the corner but nothing comes from it. 
53: Ederson has his hands up as he makes his way back to his goal, as he chases down a pass intended for Callejon to see it out of play on the touchline. The Napoli man is protesting that the goalkeeper threw the ball away as Napoli went to take the throw in, but the referee isn't having any of it. 
52: Better from Napoli now, who are putting more pressure on Man City. A few hurried passes and clearances creeping in for the hosts, which could cost them.
50: The break is on for City as Silva powers through the middle of the park with Sane bursting around down the left with him, but he just leaves it a stride too long as Alibol is out to stop him in his tracks. 
48: Another Napoli free kick as Fernandinho fouls Zielinski. Napoli are just starting to show what they can do as they did at the end of the first half, but they make little from their advantage. 
47: Another strong opening from Man City as De Bruyne produces a peach of a pass to Sterling down the right wing, but the latter's cross into the box - intended for Jesus - is cut out well by Alibol. Napoli then win the free kick as Sterling clatters into the back of Ghoulam.
46: Napoli get the game back underway at the Etihad Stadium.

A very entertaining first half of football at the Etihad where Man City continued their fine form in front of goal with early strikes from Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus. Napoli could have pulled one back but Dries Mertens saw his penalty saved by Ederson and City could, realistically, added another two to their tally. Plenty more to come in the second half!
45: Another burst forward from City, who always look like scoring when they attack, but Jesus' attempt at the near post is well saved by Reina. No added time and the referee blows his whistle. 
44: Free kick to Napoli now on the right as Silva catches Callejon with an arm as they both go up for a challenge. The Napoli man makes a bit of a meal of it, but the visitors have the free kick. Meanwhile, in another incident, De Bruyne goes into the book.
42: Napoli are starting to ask a few more questions of Man City now but are yet to have a real chance from open play. It looks like the initial shell shock is wearing off a bit as Hysajs makes his way into the box, looking for Mertens at the goal mouth but Walker is there to clear. 
41: A free kick to Man City on the right as Sterling is fouled. De Bruyne takes but it does not make it past the wall. 
38: SAVED! Wow, a fantastic save from Ederson with his legs to deny Mertens from the spot before the Belgian tries to score the rebound, but Fernandinho is racing in to clear the danger. A huge roar goes up from the home crowd and Man City maintain their 2-0 lead. 
37: PENALTY NAPOLI! Kyle Walker is penalised for dragging down Albiol in the box. He has both arms wrapped around him and you can't really argue with that. A yellow for Walker and Mertens is stepping up... 
36: Great defending from Delph there as his sloppy pass allows Napoli to get forwards, but before Mertens can find Hamsik, the Man City defender is back to muscle the Napoli man off the ball and see it out of play. 
35: CHANCE! Well, the best Napoli have had so far. Insigne does well to wriggle around Sterling at the top of the box before finding Callejon at the back post. He meets the delivery with a header, but Ederson does well to collect.
33: Napoli are seeing their best spell on the ball so far, but they aren't making too many forays into the box just yet. 
31: Free kick to Napoli as Insigne is pulled back by De Bruyne, who actually gets him around the top of the chest before he goes to ground. Not the cleverest of moves from the Belgian, there. 

29: NO GOAL!!! Another close one for City as Jesus tries to hit home on the turn but his shot is stopped bang on the line by Koulibaly, who manages to hack the ball away to safety. The GLT replay shows that the whole ball was no over the line and therefore, no goal. Another is coming though. 
27: Free kick to City as De Bruyne is fouled by Koulibaly. Sane and De Bruyne over it... Sane takes but it hammers straight into the wall.
26: OFF THE POST!!! Oh my goodness, how has De Bruyne not scored there?!It's another absolutely superb break from Man City as Sterling powers through the middle of the park, but rather than going for goal himself, he picks out Sane on the left. The German in turn finds De Bruyne at the top of the box who hammers an effort towards Reina. It's the sweetest curler but it absolutely smashes the underside of the crossbar before landing the wrong side of the goal line. We've seen him score from there before but not quite today! Yet... 
24: Man City are just knocking the ball between themselves at the moment without any real pressure from Napoli at the back. But they work it well forward as Sane punts a ball through the box but Sterling cannot connect. CLOSE!! Nearly a third for City as Fernandinho latches onto another Napoli loose pass and picks out the run of Silva in the box, but the captain's outstretched leg just pokes the ball wide. 
20: Poor from Zielinski as his loose pass is latched on to by De Bruyne. You don't want him on a loose pass, let me tell you. The Belgian bursts forward and there is plenty of tika taka passing between the attacking players and as Silva tries to slot Sane through, Alibol does well to get back and challenge. 
18: A great run from Sterling as De Bruyne pumps a ball down the right flank, looking for the winger to latch onto it and he does, but there is no one there to help and he is forced to play it back.
